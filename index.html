            Fine words and an insinuating apperance are seldom associated with true virtue (C.A. quote 6)
          </li>
          <li>
            He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his
            dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his
            speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified: such a person may be said
            indeed to love to learn (C.A. quote 22) </li>
          <li>
            Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "He acts before he speaks, and
            afterwards speaks according to his actions" (C.A. quote 50)</li>
          <li>The studnet of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery?
            But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of
            drinking. In his contention, he is still the CHun-tsze (C.A. quote 74)</li>
          <li>It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man is selected a residence
            do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise? (C.A. quote 102)</li>
          <li>Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a
            condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue (C.A. quote 103)</li>
          <li>It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others (C.A. quote 104)</li>
          <li>If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness (C.A. quote 105)</li>
          <li>If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name? (C.A. quote 107)</li>
          <li>The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of
            haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it (C.A. quote 108)</li>
          <li>I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue,
            would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that
            he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person (C.A. quote 109)</li>
          <li>Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors (C.A. quote 131)</li>
          <li>The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent
            consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue (C.A. quote 199)</li>
          <li>The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous
            are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived (C.A. 200)</li>
          <li>Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing
            to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others (C.A. quote 208)</li>
          <li>To be able to judge others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue (C.A. quote
            209)</li>
          <li>Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand (C.A. quote 249)</li>
          <li>If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man
            be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music? (C.A. quote 68)</li>
          <li>I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty (C.A. quote 320)</li>

          <li>The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it
            may be known that he is virtuous (C.A. quote 112)</li>
          <li>A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be
            discoursed with (C.A. quote 114)</li>
          <li>The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the
            sanctions of the law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive (C.A. 116)</li>
          <li>The mind of a superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with
            gain (C.A. quote 122)</li>
          <li>How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character? (C.A. quote 47)</li>
          <li>There was Yen Hui; he loved to learn. He did not transfer his anger; he did not repeat a fault.
            Unfortunately, his appointed time was short and he died; and now there is not such another. I have not yet
            heard of any one who loves to learn as he did (C.A. quote 178)</li>
          <li>The philosopher Tsang said, "Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man indeed (C.A. quote 268)</li>
          <li>How majestic was the manner in which Shun and Yu held possession of the empire, as if it were nothing to them (C.A. quote 285)</li>
          <li>The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress (C.A. quote 258)</li>
          <li>
            When Ch'ih was proceeding to Chi'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard
            that a superior man helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich (C.A. quote 180)

            8)</li>

          <li>I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without
            the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?
            (C.A. quote 61)</li>

            well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?"<br>The Master said, "The
            buisiness of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground." (C.A. quote 75-76)</li>

          <li>Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel. This Yu, -what is the use
            of my reproving him? (C.A. quote 148)</li>

          <li>The Master said, "There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it lowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!" (C.A. quote 323) The Master said, "A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect (C.A. quote 324)</li>

            A youth when at home should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and
            truthful. He should overfow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and
            opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies (C.A. quote 9)
          </li>
          <li>In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline
            to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and
            should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur (C.A. quote 124)</li>
          <li>While his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance. If he does go abroad, he must have a
            fied place to which he goes (C.A. quote 125)</li>
          <li>The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for
            fear (C.A. quote 127)</li>
            <li>
              Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them (C.A. quote 12(4))

            If the scholar be not grave he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid. (C.A.

          <li>
            If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of
            others (C.A. quote 48) </li>
          <li>Let me return! Let me return! The little children of my school are ambitious and too hasty. They are
            accomplished and complete so far, but they do not know how to restrict and shape themselves (C.A. quote 163)

          <li>The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being
            able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is not
            good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude (C.A. quote 212)</li>
          <li>From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused instruction
            to anyone (C.A. quote 219)</li>
          <li>I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not
            anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it
            learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson (C.A. quote 220)</li>
          <li>There were four things which the Master taught, -letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness (C.A. quote 241)</li>
          <li>I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired. Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without guaranteeing his past conduct (C.A. quote 248)</li>
          <li>Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, "I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind (C.A. quote 308)</li>
          <li>"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety (C.A. quote 309) </li>
          <li>When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so (C.A. quote 310)</li>

I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu (C.A. quote 292)</li>
