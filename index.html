          <li>If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such
            a relaxation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of
            K'wang do to me? (C.A. quote 301)</li>
          <li>My friends, why are you distressed by our master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the
            principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with it's wooden tongue (C.A.
            quote 99)</li>
          <li>Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is
            perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will
            ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?"
            (C.A. quote 455)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said to him, "There is the following saying which I have heard-'Death and life have their
            determined appointment; riches and honors depend upon Heaven.' (C.A. quote 465)</li>
          <li>The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot
            be taken from him (C.A. quote 327)</li>
          <li>He revived states that had been extinguished, restored whose line of succession had been broken, and
            called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the
            people turned towards him. (C.A. quote 843)</li>

          <li>A man should say, I am not concerned I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am
            not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known (C.A. 119)</li>
          <li>When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we
            should turn inwards and examine ourselves (C.A. quote 123)</li>
          <li>I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability (C.A. quote
            607)</li>
          <li>In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do
            sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual. (C.A. quote
            666)</li>
          <li>He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and
            yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?" (C.A. quote 608)
          </li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, "He does not tread in the
            footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage." (C.A. quote 429)</li>
          <li>The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to the chief criminal judge, the latter consulted
            the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, "The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have
            been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and
            pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability." (C.A. 823)</li>
            <li>The duke then said, "Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?" Confucius replied, "Such an
              effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have
              no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say (C.A. quote
              536)</li>

          <li>Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of the men dressed in furs,
            and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this! (C.A. 328)</li>

            insinuating talker?" (C.A. quote 609) Confucius said, "I do not dare to play the part of such a talker, but
            I hate obstinacy." (C.A. quote 610)</li>

          <li>I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men (C.A. quote
            26)</li>
          <li>He was of an active nature and yet fond of learning, and he was not ashamed to ask and learn of his
            inferiors!-On these grounds he has been styled Wan (C.A. quote 155)</li>
          <li>The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, "Wherein I
            have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!" (C.A. quote 205)</li>
          <li>Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite emptylike,
            ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it (C.A. quote 305)</li>
          <li>"What are your wishes, Ch'ih," said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, "I do not say that my
            ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple,
            and the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe and
            the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant." (C.A. quote 448)</li>
          <li>The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me,
            that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness." Kung-hsi Hwa said, "This
            is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in" (C.A. quote 255)</li>
          <li>
            A sage it is not mine to see; could I see a man of real talent and virtue, that would satisfy me (C.A. quote
            242)
          </li>
          <li>A good man it is not mine to see; could I see a man possessed of constancy, that would satisfy me (C.A.
            quote 243)</li>
          <li>He asked about Kwan Chung. "For him," said the Master, "the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was
            taken from the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmurring word, though, to the end of his life,
            he had only coarse rice to eat." (C.A. quote 572)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "What do you mean by thus saying-that no one knows you?" The Master replied, "I do not
            murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But
            there is Heaven;-that knows me!" (C.A. quote 616)</li>
          <li>I can find no flaw in the character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but displayed the utmost
            filial piety towards the spirits. His ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost elegance in
            his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low, mean house, but expended all his strength on the ditches
            and water channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu (C.A. quote 292)</li>
          <li>T'ang said, "I the child Li, presume to use a dark-colored victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most
            great and sovereign God, that the sinner I dare not pardon, and thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in
            obscurity. The examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I commit offenses, they are not
            to be attributed to you, the people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions commit offenses,
            these offenses must rest on my person." (C.A. quote 839)</li>

          <li>The Master said, "If good men were to govern a country in succession for a hundred years, they would be
            able to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital punhishments.' True indeed is this saying!"
            (C.A. quote 529) The Master said, "If a truly royal ruler were to arise, it would sti[ll] require a
            generation, and then
            virtue would prevail (C.A. quote 530)</li>
          <li>The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days
            no court was held. Confucius took his departure (C.A. quote 780)</li>

          <li>The Master said, "Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in
            memory?" (C.A. quote 635) Tsze-kung replied, "Yes,-but perhaps it is not so?" (C.A. quote 636) "No," was the
            answer; "I seek a unity all pervading." (C.A. quote 637)</li>

          <li>When the Master was in Ch'i, he heard the Shao, and for three months did not know the taste of flesh. "I
            did not think" he said, "that music could have been made so excellent as this" (C.A. quote 228)</li>
          <li>There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important: that
            in his deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he
            keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to
            matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them (C.A. quote 266)

          <li>The philosopher Tsang said, "The officer may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance. His

          <li>The Duke of Sheh asked Tsze-lu about Confucius, and Tsze-lu did not answer him. (C.A. 234) The Master
            said, "Why did you not say to him, -He is simply a man, who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his
            food, who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows, and who does not perceive that old age is coming
            on?" (C.A. quote 235)</li>

          <li>Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to sustain;-is it not heavy? Only with death

            not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it, - this is knowledge (C.A. quote 54)</li>
          <li>There may be those who act without knowing why. I do not do so. Hearing much and selecting what is good

          <li>The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery?
            But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of
            drinking. In his contention, he is still the CHun-tsze (C.A. quote 74)</li>
          <li>It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man is selected a residence
            do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise? (C.A. quote 102)</li>
          <li>Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a
            condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue (C.A. quote 103)</li>
          <li>It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others (C.A. quote 104)</li>

          <li>The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of
            haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it (C.A. quote 108)</li>
          <li>I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue,
            would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that
            he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person (C.A. quote 109)</li>
          <li>Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors (C.A. quote 131)</li>

            consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue (C.A. quote 199)</li>
          <li>The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous
            are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived (C.A. 200)</li>
          <li>Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing

          <li>The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech (C.A. quote 459)</li>
          <li>Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one
            as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice;
            not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country,
            and none in the family." Chung-kung said, "Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it
            my business to practice this lesson." (C.A. quote 457)</li>
          <li>Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the
            management of business, to reverently attentive; in intercourse with others to be strictly sincere. Though a
            man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected." (C.A. quote 543)</li>

            his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and "My wishes," he said, "are different
            from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen." "What harm is there in that?" said the Master; "do
            you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes." Tien then said, "In this, the last month of spring, with
            the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six or
            seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing." The

            of them should be foregone?" The Master answered, "Part with the food. From of old, death has been the lot

          <li>Pi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master was inclined to go. (C.A. quote 736) Tsze-lu said, "Master,
            formerly I have heard you say, 'When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a superior man will
            not associate with him.' Pi Hsi is in rebellion, holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him, what
            shall be said?" (C.A. quote 737) The Master said, "Yes, I did use these words. But is it not said, that, if
            a thing be really hard, it may be ground without being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be really
            white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made black? (C.A. quote 738)</li>

            you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?" asked the other. "I am," replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to
            him, "Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its
            state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better
            follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and
            proceeded with his work, without stopping. (C.A. quote 785) Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when
            the Master observed with a sigh, "It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the
            same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associated? If right
            principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state." (C.A. quote 786)

          <li>Tsze-lu then said to the family, "Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and
            young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between
            sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to come to
            confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure

            Poetry? (C.A. quote 743) The Odes serve to stimulate the mind. (C.A. quote 744) They may be used for

            show how to regulate feelings of resentment (bitter indignation at having been treated unfairly) (C.A. quote
            747). From them you learn the more immediate duty of serving one’s father, and the remoter one of serving
            one’s prince. From them we become largely acquainted with the names of birds, beasts, and plants.” (C.A.

          <li>Tsai Wo asked about the three years' mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough (C.A.
            quote 765) "If the superior man," said he, "abstains for three years from the observances of propriety,
            those observances will be quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will be ruined.

          <li>Tsze-chang asked Confucius saying, "In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may
            conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the
            four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang said, "What are meant by the five
            excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without the great
            expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining (feel or express discontent; fret);
            when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being
            proud; when he is majestic without being fierce." (C.A. quote 846) Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by being
            beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more
            beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent
            without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who
            will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of
            covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare
            to indicate any disrespect;-is not htis to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his
            clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-is
            not this to be majestic without being fierce?" (C.A. quote 848)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang then asked, "What are meant by the four bad things?" The Master said, "To put the people to
            death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale
            of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without
            urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And,
            generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part of
            a mere official." (C.A. quote 848)</li>

            not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with.' I retired and studied the Odes. (C.A. quote 719)
            Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and

            learn the rules of Propriety, your character cannot be established.' I then retired, and learned the rules
            of Propriety. (C.A. quote 720) I have heard only these two things from him. (C.A. quote 721) Ch'ang K'ang

            talents for every employment." (C.A. quote 802)</li>

          <li>The head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu. (C.A. quote 689) Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an
            interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu."
            (C.A. quote 690) Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here? (C.A. 691) Now, in regard to
            Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang;
            moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct connection
            with the sovereign; What has your chief to do with attacking it?" (C.A. quote 692) Zan Yu said, "Our master
            wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it." (C.A. quote 693) Confucius said, "Ch'iu, there are
            the words of Chau Zan, -'When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office; when
            he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who does
            not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' (C.A. quote 694) "And further, you speak
            wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in
            its repository:-whose is the fault?" (C.A. quote 695) Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and
            near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants." (C.A. quote
            696) Confucius said. "Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,'
            and framing explanations for their conduct. (C.A. quote 697)</li>
          <li>The duke Ching of Chi'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, "I cannot
            treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the
            chief of the Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family." He also said, "I am old; I cannot use his
            doctrines." Confucius took his departure. (C.A. quote 799)</li>

          <li>A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with our
            old P'ang (C.A. quote 210)</li>
          <li>In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the
            approbation of others." (C.A. qute 598)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang said, "What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial
            mourning, was for three years without speaking?" (C.A. quote 625) The Master said, "Why must Kao-tsung be
            referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all
            attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years." (C.A. quote

          <li>Anciently, men had three failings, which now perhaps are not to be found. (C.A. quote 757) The

            present day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve; the
            stern dignity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. The stupidity of antiquity showed

            A youth when at home should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and
            truthful. He should overfow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and
            opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies (C.A. quote 9)

          <li>In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline

            should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur (C.A. quote 124)</li>

            more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back."</li>
          <li>The virtuous will be sure to speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not always be virtuous.
            Men of principle are sure to be bold, but those who are bold may not always be men of principle (C.A. quote
            565)</li>
          <li>Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man,
            and, at the same time, virtuous (C.A. quote 567)</li>
          <li>The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu, Ching-po informed Confucius of it, saying,
            "Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut
            Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court." (C.A. quote 617) The Master said, "If my
            principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can
            the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?" (C.A. quote 618) The Master said, "Some men of worth
            retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks. Some
            retire because of contradictory language." (C.A. quote 619) The Master said, "Those who have done this are
            seven men." (C.A. quote 620)</li>
          <li>Yu[-I] those who know virtue are few (C.A. quote 638)</li>
          <li>Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was like
            an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good
            government prevails in his state, his is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll
            his principles up, and keep them in his breast." (C.A. quote 644)</li>
          <li>When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not
            be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to their
            man nor to their words (C.A. quote 645)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung asked, saying, "What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people in his neighborhood?"
            The Master replied, "We may not for that accord our approval of him." "And what do you say of him who is
            hated by all the people of his neighborhood?" The Master said, "We may not for that conclude that he is bad.
            It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him."
            (C.A. quote 553)</li>
          <li>The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it
            may be known that he is virtuous (C.A. quote 112)</li>
          <li>A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be

          <li>How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character? (C.A. quote 47)</li>
          <li>A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his
            vistors. Some one asked about him, saying, "I suppose he has made great progress." (C.A. quote 630) The
            Master said, "I observe that he fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks
            shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes
            quickly to become a man." (C.A. quote 631)</li>
          <li>It is not easy to find a man who has learned for three years without coming to be good (C.A. quote 277)

          </li>
          <li>Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, "Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?" The
            Master said, "The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives
            way to unbridled license." (C.A. quote 634)</li>
          <li>Mang Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is not fit to
            be great officer to either of the states Tang or Hsieh (C.A. quote 574)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to
            assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?" The Master said, "Why speak
            only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were
            still solicitous about this (C.A. quote 207)</li>
          <li>Though a man have abilities as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud and niggardly,
            those other things are really not worth being looked at (C.A. quote 276)</li>

          <li>Tsze-kung said, "What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man
            who is not proud? The Master replied, "They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet
            cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety (C.A. quote 23)</li>
          <li>In a hamlet of ten families, there may be found one honorable and sincere as I am, but not so fond of
            learning (C.A. 172)</li>
          <li>They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those
            who delight in it (C.A. quote 197)</li>


          <li>To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy (C.A. quote 573)</li>
          <li>The superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be interested with great concerns. The
            small man may not be interested with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters (C.A. quote 678)
          </li>
          <li>The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic (C.A. quote 51)
          </li>
          <li>I have not seen a firm and unbending man. Ch'ang... is under the influence of his passions; how can he be
            pronounced firm and unbending? (C.A. quote 150)</li>
          <li>It is all over. I have not yet seen one who could percieve his faults, and inwardly accuse himself (C.A.
            quote 171)</li>

          <li>Living in retirement to study their aims, and practicing righteousness to carry out their principles:-I
            have heard these words, but I have not seen such men (C.A. quote 715)</li>
          <li>The Duke of Ch'i had a thousand teams, each of four horses, but on the day of his death, the people did
            not praise him for a single virtue. Po-i and Shu-chi'i died of hunger at the foot of the Shau-yang
            mountains, and the people, down to the present time, praise them (C.A. quote 716)</li>
          <li>Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue (C.A. quote 759)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "If you were, after a year, to eat good rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you
            feel at ease?" "I should," replied Wo. (C.A. quote 767) The Master said, "If you can feel at ease, do it.
            But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor
            derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged.
            Therefore he does not do what you propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it." (C.A. quote 768) Tsai Wo
            then went out, and the Master said, "This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years
            old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally
            observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his parents?" (C.A. 769)</li>
          <li>Hard is it to deal with who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to
            anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than
            doing nothing at all (C.A. quote 770)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu said, "Does the superior man esteem valor?" The Master said, "The superior man holds righteousness
            to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be
            guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without righteousness, will commit robbery."
            (C.A. quote 771)</li>
          <li>"Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame

          <li>The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the
            sanctions of the law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive (C.A. 116)</li>
          <li>The mind of a superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with
            gain (C.A. quote 122)</li>

          <li>The philosopher Tsang said, "Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a
            young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no
            emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man
            indeed (C.A. quote 268)</li>

          <li>The superior man is satisfied and composed; the mean man is always full of distress (C.A. quote 258)</li>
          <li>
            When Ch'ih was proceeding to Chi'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard
            that a superior man helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich (C.A. quote 180)
          </li>
          <li>He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good (C.A. quote 329)</li>

          <li>"Cautious and slow in his speech!" said Niu;-"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?" The Master said,
            "When a man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?" (C.A. quote
            460)</li>
          <li>Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, "The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear
            (C.A. quote 461)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, "He with whom neither slander that
            gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be
            called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are
            successful, may be called farseeing." (C.A. quote 467)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to
            perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this." (C.A. quote 486)</li>
          <li>Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's
            words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be
            distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan (C.A. quote 494)</li>

          <li>The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear (C.A. quote 332)
          </li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not
            affable (C.A) quote 552)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in
            any way which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses
            them according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you try to
            please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his
            employment of men, he wishes to be equal to everything." (C.A. quote 554)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man has a dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without a
            dignified ease." (C.A. quote 555)</li>
          <li>The superior man is modest in his speech, but exeeds in his actions (C.A. quote 603)</li>
          <li>The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxities;
            wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear (C.A. quote 604)</li>

          <li>Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "The cultivation of himself in
            reverential carefulness." "And is this all?" said Tzze-lu. "He cultivates himself so as to give rest to
            others," was the reply. "And is this all?" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, "He cultivates himself so
            as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao and
            Shun were still solicitous about this." (C.A. quote 628)</li>



          <li>The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their
            virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete (C.A. quote 646)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it
            according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is
            indeed a superior man." (C.A. quote 659)</li>
          <li>The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him (C.A.
            quote 660)</li>
          <li>The superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death (C.A. quote 661)
          </li>
          <li>What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others (C.A. quote 662)</li>
          <li>The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan (C.A. quote 663)
          </li>
          <li>The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words
            because of the man (C.A. quote 664)</li>
          <li>The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is
            sometimes want. So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man in anxious lest he should
            not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him (C.A. quote 674)</li>
          <li>The superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be interested with great concerns. The
            small man may not be interested with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters (C.A. quote 678)
          </li>
          <li>The superior man is correctly firm, and not firm merely (C.A. quote 681)</li>
          <li>Therefore a superior man consider it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and
            also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in
            his words there may be nothing incorrect (C.A. quote 517)</li>
          <li>The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct (C.A. quote 130)</li>

          <li>The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules
            of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right (C.A. quote 204)</li>
          <li>There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of
            Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of the sages (C.A. quote 710)</li>
          <li>The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to the
            use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear
            distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his demeanor,
            he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be
            sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that is should be reverently careful. In regard
            to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties
            his anger may involve him in. When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness. (C.A. quote 713)</li>
          <li>Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil! and shrinking from
            it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:-I have seen such men, as I have heard such
            words (C.A. quote 714)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Has the superior man his hatreds also?" The Master said, "He has his hatreds. He hates
            those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his superiors.
            He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and
            determined, and, at the same time, of contracted understanding." (C.A. quote 772)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern;
            when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided." (C.A. quote 812)

            (C.A. quote 156)</li>
          <li>I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat,
            dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is
            fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution (C.A. 225)</li>

          <li>Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao

            Master said, "He who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will
            not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer." (C.A. quote 544)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu asked, saying, "What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?" The
            Master said, "He must be thus,-earnest, urgent, and band:-among his friends, earnest and urgent; among his
            brethren, bland." (C.A. quote 557)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, "Suppose a man with the knowledge of Tsang
            Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of CHwang of Pien, and the varied talents
            of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and music;-such a one might be
            reckoned a COMPLETE man." (C.A. quote 575)</li>
          <li>But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in
            the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and

          <li>He who speaks without modesty will find it difficult to make his words good (C.A. quote 590)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. (C.A. quote 640)
            The Master said, "Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such conduct
            may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful
            and his actions not honorable and careful will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his
            neighborhood? (C.A. quote 641) "When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting him.
            When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into
            practice." (C.A. quote 642)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home to serve one's father and elder
            brothers in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of
            wine:-which one of the things do I attain to?" (C.A. quote 318) The Master standing by a stream said, "It
            passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!" (C.A. quote 319)</li>
          <li>To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and while respecting spiritual beings, to keep
            aloof from them, may be called wisdom (C.A. quote 199)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang said, "The scholar, trained for pubic duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice
            his life. When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of rigthtousness. In sacrificing, his
            thoughts, are reverential. In mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel. Such a man
            commands our approbation indeed" (C.A. quote 804)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not
            forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn." (C.A. quote 808)</li>

            being so?" Confucius again said, "No." "The days and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us."

            Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself

            word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. (C.A. quote 834) Our

          <li>Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find verified

            be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and

            at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be good. The relation between

          <li>When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not
            point with his hands (C.A. quote 394)</li>
          <li>When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said,
            "Master, your grief is excessive!" (C.A. quote 408) "Is it excessive?" said he. "If I am not to mourn
            bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?" (C.A. quote 409)</li>
          <li>There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no

            are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve towards them, they are
            discontented." (C.A. quote 774)</li>

          <li>Some one said, "What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness?"
            (C.A. quote 612) The Master said, "With what then will you recompense kindness?" (C.A. quote 613)
            "Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness." (C.A. quote 614) The Master said,
            "Alas! there is no one that knows me." (C.A. quote 615)</li>
          <li>Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation? He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of
            Liu-hsia, and yet did not procure that he should stand with him in court (C.A. quote 655)</li>
          <li>When a man is not in the habit of saying-'What shall I think of this? What shall I think of this?' I can
            indeed do nothing with him! (C.A. quote 657)</li>
          <li>The Master said to Po-yu, "Do you give yourself to the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan. The man who has not
            studied the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan is like one who stands with his face right against a wall. Is he not
            so?" The Master said, "It is according to the rules of propriety,' they say. Are gems and silk all that is
            meant by propriety? 'It is music,' they say. Are hers and drums all that is meant by music?" (C.A. quote
            750) The Master said, "he who puts on an appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like
            one of the small people;-yea, is he not like the thief who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?" (C.A.
            quote 751) The Master said, "Your good, careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue." (C.A.
            quote 752) The Master said, "To tell, as we go along, what we have heard on the way, is to cast away our
            virtue." (C.A. quote 753) The Master said, "There are those mean creatures! How impossible it is along with
            them to serve one's prince! (C.A. quote 754) While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is how to get
            them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest they should lose them. (C.A. quote 755) When they are
            anxious lest such things should be lost, there is nothing to which they will not proceed." (C.A. quote 756)

            Tsai Wo asked, saying, "A benevolent man, though it be told him, -'There is a man in the well' will go in

            full, and yet counting himself as empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; formerly I

          <li>The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do
            something in the way of support; without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from
            the other? (C.A. quote 41)</li>
          <li>High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning
            conducted without sorrow; -wherewith should I contemplate such ways? (C.A. quote 101)</li>

          <li>The Duke Ching, of ch'i, asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, "There is government, when

            be heard of through the state, to be heard of throughout his clan." (C.A. quote 492) The Master said, "That
            is notoriety, not distinction." (C.A. quote 493) "As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of
            virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without any doubts about himself.
            Such a man will be heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan." (C.A. quote 495)</li>

            When good order prevailed in his country, Ning Wu acted the part of a wise man. When his country was in
