          <li>The Story of Uttara the Lay-Disciple: The Buddha then said, "Well done, well done, Uttara! By not bearing any ill will you have been able to conquer one who has done you wrong through hate. By not abusing, you should conquer one who abuses you; by being generous you should conquer one who is stingy; by speaking the truth you should conquer one who tells lies."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Dhammarama: The Buddha was satisfied and was very pleased with the explanation and conduct of Dhammarama and he said, "My son, Dhammarama, you have done very well. A bhikkhu who loves and respects me should act like you. Those who made offerings of flowers, scents and incense to me are not really paying me homage. Only those who practise the Dhamma are the ones who truly pay homage to me."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 415: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has given up sensual pleasures, and leaving the home-life has become a bhikkhu; who has eradicated sensual desires and has come to the end of existence.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such
            a relaxation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of
            K'wang do to me? (C.A. quote 301)</li>
          <li>My friends, why are you distressed by our master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the
            principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with it's wooden tongue (C.A.
            quote 99)</li>
          <li>Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is
            perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will
            ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?"
            (C.A. quote 455)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said to him, "There is the following saying which I have heard-'Death and life have their
            determined appointment; riches and honors depend upon Heaven.' (C.A. quote 465)</li>
          <li>The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot
            be taken from him (C.A. quote 327)</li>
          <li>He revived states that had been extinguished, restored whose line of succession had been broken, and
            called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the
            people turned towards him. (C.A. quote 843)</li>

          <li> Dhammapada Verse 10: He who has discarded all moral defilements (kilesas), who is established in moral
            precepts, is endowed with restraint and (speaks the) truth is, indeed, worthy of the yellow robe.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 12: They take truth for truth; they take untruth for untruth; such persons arrive at the
            truth, for they hold right views. At the end of the discourse, many people came to be established in
            Sotapatti Fruition.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada verse 20: Though he recites only a little of the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but practises
            according to the Dhamma,
            eradicating passion, ill will and ignorance, clearly comprehending the Dhamma, with his mind freed from
            moral
            defilements and no longer clinging to this world or to the next, he shares the benefits of the life of a
            bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 50: One should not consider the faults of others, nor their doing or not doing good or
            bad deeds. One should consider only whether one has done or not done good or bad deeds.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 52: Just as a flower, beautiful as well as fragrant, will give the wearer the benefit of
            its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha will benefit one who practises the Dhamma.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 84: For his own sake or for the sake of others, he does no evil; nor does he wish for
            sons
            and daughters or for wealth or for a kingdom by doing evil; nor does he wish for success by unfair means;
            such a one is indeed virtuous, wise and just. </li>
          <li>The Story of Lajadevadhita: So he told her not to come to the monastery any more, as people might start
            talking if she kept on coming to the monastery. Lajadevadhita was very upset; she pleaded with the thera and
            cried, "Please do not destroy my riches, my wealth." The Buddha heard her cries and sent forth the radiance
            from his chamber and said to the female deva, "Devadhita, it is the duty of my son Kassapa to stop your
            coming to the monastery; to do good deeds is the duty of one who is anxious to gain merit."</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>

          <li>A man should say, I am not concerned I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am
            not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known (C.A. 119)</li>
          <li>When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we
            should turn inwards and examine ourselves (C.A. quote 123)</li>
          <li>I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability (C.A. quote
            607)</li>
          <li>In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do
            sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual. (C.A. quote
            666)</li>
          <li>He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and
            yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?" (C.A. quote 608)
          </li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, "He does not tread in the
            footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage." (C.A. quote 429)</li>
          <li>The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to the chief criminal judge, the latter consulted
            the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, "The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have
            been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and
            pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability." (C.A. 823)</li>
          <li>The duke then said, "Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?" Confucius replied, "Such an
            effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have
            no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say (C.A. quote
            536)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu never slept over a promise (C.A. quote 482)</li>
          <li>But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in
            the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and
            who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man
            (C.A. quote 576)</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The Story of Sirima: The Buddha then asked the king to get a town crier announce that Sirima would be
            available on payment of one thousand in cash per night. But no body would take her for one thousand, or for
            five hundred, or for two hundred and fifty, or even if she were to be given free of charge. Then the Buddha
            said to the audience, "Bhikkhus! Look at Sirima. When she was living, there were many who were willing to
            give one thousand to spend one night with her; but now none would take her even if given without any
            payment. The body of a person is subject to deterioration and decay."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 147: Look at this dressed up body, a mass of sores, supported (by bones), sickly, a
            subject of many thoughts (of sensual desire). Indeed, that body is neither permanent nor enduring. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 148: This body is worn out-with age, it is the seat of sickness, it is subject to decay.
            This putrid body disintegrates; life, indeed, ends in death. </li>
          <li>The Story of Queen Mallika: To him the Buddha said, "Look at these carriages of your father and your
            grandfather; these are all worn down and lying useless; so also is your body, which is subject to death and
            decay. Only the Dhamma of the Virtuous is not subject to decay."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 151: The much ornamented royal carriages do wear out, the body also grows old, but the
            Dhamma of the Virtuous does not decay. Thus, indeed, say the Virtuous among themselves. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 160: One indeed is one's own refuge; how can others be a refuge to one? With oneself
            thoroughly tamed, one can attain a refuge (i.e., Arahatta Phala), which is so difficult to attain. </li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: As soon as they entered the compound of the monastery, a storm broke
            out; as big drops of rain fell, bubbles were formed on the ground and soon disappeared. Seeing those
            bubbles, the bhikkhus reflected "This body of ours is perishable like the bubbles", and perceived the
            impermanent nature of the aggregates (khandhas).</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sammajjana: Other bhikkhus noticed some rubbish piling up in the compound and they
            asked Sammajjana why he was not sweeping as much as he used to, and he replied, "When I was not mindful, I
            was all the time sweeping; but now I am no longer unmindful." When the bhikkhus heard his reply they were
            sceptical; so they went to the Buddha and said, "Venerable Sir! Thera Sammajjana falsely claims himself to
            be an arahat; he is telling lies." To them the Buddha said, "Sammajjana has indeed attained arahatship; he
            is telling the truth."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Young Bride: By his supernormal power, the Buddha willed that the bride would not be visible to the bridegroom. When the young man could no longer see the young woman, he could pay full attention to the Buddha, and his love and respect for the Buddha grew stronger in him. Then the Buddha said to the young man, "O young man, there is no fire like the fire of passion; there is no evil like anger and hatred; there is no ill like the burden of the five aggregates of existence (khandhas); there is no bliss like the Perfect Peace of Nibbana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 276: You yourselves should make the effort; the Tathagatas (Buddhas) only can show the way. Those who practise the Tranquillity and Insight Meditation are freed from the bond of Mara.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: So they went to the Buddha and said, "Thera Tissa claims himself to be an arahat ; he is not speaking the truth." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, my son Tissa was speaking the truth when he said he did not get angry. He has indeed become an arahat he is no longer attached to anyone; he has no occasion to get angry with anyone nor any need to associate with others."</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Dhammadinna: His wife Dhammadinna retorted, "Who would swallow the spittle you have thrown up?" Then she asked permission from him to enter the Order and became a bhikkhuni. After becoming a bhikkhuni she went to a monastery in a small village in the company of other bhikkhunis to practise meditation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not
            forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn." (C.A. quote 808)</li>
          <li>Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not
            lead to the instruction of its object? (C.A. quote 568)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "I would prefer not speaking." (C.A. quote 761) Tsze-kung said, "If you, Master, do not
            speak, what shall we, your disciples, have to record?" (C.A. quote 762) The Master said, "Does Heaven
            speak?
            The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say
            anything?" (C.A. quote 763)</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 365: One should not despise what one has received (by proper means), nor should one envy others their gains. The bhikkhu who envies others cannot attain Concentration (Samadhi).
            Verse 366: Though he receives only a little, if a bhikkhu does not despise what he has received (by proper means), the devas will surely praise him who leads a pure life and is not slothful.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Giver of the First-Fruits of His Labour: To him the Buddha replied, "O brahmin! Any rice is suitable for me, whether it is not yet consumed, or is partly consumed, or even if it is the last remaining spoonful."</li>
          <li>The Story of Four Samaneras: When other bhikkhus asked the samaneras whether they did net get angry when the brahmin couple refused to offer alms-food to them, they answered in the negative. </li>

          <li>I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men (C.A. quote

          <li>He was of an active nature and yet fond of learning, and he was not ashamed to ask and learn of his
            inferiors!-On these grounds he has been styled Wan (C.A. quote 155)</li>
          <li>The Master having visited Nan-tsze, Tsze-lu was displeased, on which the Master swore, saying, "Wherein
            I
            have done improperly, may Heaven reject me, may Heaven reject me!" (C.A. quote 205)</li>
          <li>Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite emptylike,
            ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it (C.A. quote 305)</li>
          <li>"What are your wishes, Ch'ih," said the Master next to Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, "I do not say that
            my
            ability extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the services of the ancestral temple,
            and the audiences of the princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark square-made robe
            and
            the black linen cap, to act as a small assistant." (C.A. quote 448)</li>
          <li>The sage and the man of perfect virtue;-how dare I rank myself with them? It may simply be said of me,
            that I strive to become such without satiety, and teach others without weariness." Kung-hsi Hwa said,
            "This
            is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in" (C.A. quote 255)</li>

In their presence, Mara taunted the Buddha, "O Buddha, since you received no alms-food this morning, you must be feeling the pangs of hunger!" To him the Buddha replied, "O wicked Mara, even though we do not get any food, like the Abhassara brahmas who live only on the delightful satisfaction (piti) and bliss (sukha) of jhana, we shall live on the delightful satisfaction and bliss of the Dhamma."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 266: He does not become a bhikkhu merely because he stands at the door for alms. He cannot become a bhikkhu because he acts according to a faith which is not in conformity with the Dhamma.

The bhikkhus took that to mean that Uggasena was claiming to have attained arahatship even then. So, they went to the Buddha and said, "Venerable Sir! Uggasena claims himself to be an arahat; he must be telling lies." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, one who has cut off all fetters, like my son Uggasena, has no fear."</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 134: If you can keep yourself calm and quiet like a broken gong which is no longer

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 143: Rare in this world is the kind of person who out of a sense of shame restrains from
            doing evil and keeps himself awake like a good horse that gives no cause to be whipped.
            Verse 144: Like a good horse stirred at a touch of the whip, be diligent and get alarmed by endless round of
            rebirths (i.e., samsara). By faith, morality, effort, concentration, discernment of the Dhamma, be endowed
            with knowledge and practice of morality, and with mindfulness, leave this immeasurable dukkha (of samsara)
            behind.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 183: Not to do evil, to cultivate merit, to purify one's mind - this is the Teaching of the Buddhas.
            Verse 184: The best moral practice is patience and forbearance; "Nibbana is Supreme", said the Buddhas. A bhikkhu does not harm others; one who harms others is not a bhikkhu.
            Verse 185: Not to revile, not to do any harm, to practise restraint according to the Fundamental Instructions for the bhikkhus, to be moderate in taking food, to dwell in a secluded place, to devote oneself to higher concentration - this is the Teaching of the Buddhas.</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 360: Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear; restraint in the nose is good, good is restraint in the tongue.
            Verse 361: Restraint in body is good, good is restraint in speech; restraint in mind is good, good is restraint in all the senses. A bhikkhu restrained in all the senses is freed from all ills (Samsara dukkha).</li>
          <li>The Story of Bhikkhu Kokalika: To those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! A bhikkhu must have control over his tongue; his conduct must be good; his mind must be calm, subdued and not flitting about as it pleases."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 375: For a wise bhikkhu in this Teaching, this is the beginning (of the practice leading to Nibbana): control of the senses, contentment, and restraint according to the Fundamental Precepts.<li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 390: For a brahmana there is no benefit at all if he does not restrain from anger to which his mind is prone. Inasmuch as one desists from the intention to harm, to that extent dukkha ceases.</li>

            keep sabbath and to learn some religious texts. To him the Buddha replied, "Anathapindika! Today, your son

          <li>Dhammapada Verses 186 & 187: Not by a shower of coins can sensual desires be satiated; sensual desires give little pleasure and are fraught with evil consequences (dukkha). Knowing this, the wise man, who is the disciple of the Buddha, does not find delight even in the pleasures of the devas, but rejoices in the cessation of craving (i.e., Nibbana). </li>
          <li>The Story of Many Bhikkhus: Once, five hundred bhikkhus were discussing the question "What constitutes happiness?" These bhikkhus realized that happiness meant different things to different people. Thus, they said, "To some people to have the riches and glory like that of a king's is happiness, to some people sensual pleasure is happiness, but to others to have good rice cooked with meat is happiness." While they were talking, the Buddha came in. After learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, all the pleasures you have mentioned do not get you out of the round of rebirths. In this world, these constitute happiness: the arising of a Buddha, the opportunity to hear the Teaching of the Sublime Truth, and the harmony amongst the bhikkhus,</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 224: One should speak the truth, one should not yield to anger, one should give when asked even if it is only a little. By means of these three, one may go to the world of the devas. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 251: There is no fire like passion, there is no grip like ill will, there is no net like ignorance, there is no river like craving. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Ujjhanasanni: The Buddha replied to them, "Bhikkhus, if someone finds fault with another so as to teach him in good way; it is not an act of evil and is therefore not to be blamed. But, if someone is always finding fault with others and speaking ill of them just out of spite and malice, he will not attain concentration and mental absorption (jhana). He will not be able to understand the Dhamma, and moral (intoxicants asavas) will increase in him."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 254: In the sky there is no track; outside the Buddha's Teaching there is no ariya bhikkhu (samana). All beings take delight in fetters (i.e., craving, pride and wrong view) that prolong samsara; all the Buddhas are free from these fetters.
            Verse 255: In the sky there is no track; outside the Buddha's Teaching there is no ariya bhikkhu (samana). There is no conditioned thing that is permanent; all the Buddhas are unperturbed (by craving, pride and wrong view).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 258: He is not a wise man just because he talks much; only he who is peaceful, free from enmity, and does no harm to others, is to be called 'a wise man'.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 270: He who harms living beings is, for that reason, not an ariya (a Noble One); he who does not harm any living being is called an ariya1.
            1. ariya: one who has realized one of the four maggas.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 273: Of paths, the Path of Eight Constituents is the noblest; of truths, the Four Noble Truths are the noblest; of the dhammas, the absence of craving (i.e., Nibbana) is the noblest; of the two-legged beings, the All-Seeing Buddha is the noblest.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 277: "All conditioned phenomena are impermanent"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom, one becomes weary of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.
            Verse 278: "All conditioned phenomena are dukkha"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom, one becomes weary of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.
            Verse 279: "All phenomena (dhammas) are without Self"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom, one becomes weary of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.</li>
          <li>The Story of Patacara*: When she approached the Buddha, he said to her, "Patacara, sons and daughters cannot look after you; so even if they are alive they do not exist for you. The wise man observes morality (sila) and clears (the obstacles to) the Path leading to Nibbana."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Wood-Cutter's Son: The king asked the Buddha, "Is mindfulness of the unique qualities of the Buddha, the only dhamma that gives one protection against evil and danger, or is mindfulness of the unique qualities of the Dhamma equally potent and powerful?" To him the Buddha replied, "O king, my disciple! There are six things, mindfulness of which is a good protection against evil and danger."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 302: It is hard to become a bhikkhu; it is hard to be happy in the practice of a bhikkhu. The hard life of a householder is painful; to live with those of a different temperament is painful. A traveller in samsara is continually subject to dukkha; therefore, do not be a traveller in samsara; do not be the one to be subject to dukkha again and again. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 348: Give up the past, give up the future, give up the present. Having reached the end of existences, with a mind freed from all (conditioned things), you will not again undergo birth and decay. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 373: The bhikkhu who goes into seclusion (to meditate), whose mind is tranquil, who clearly perceives the Dhamma, experiences the joy which transcends that of (ordinary) men.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 381: The bhikkhu who frequently feels joy and is devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha will realize Nibbana — the Tranquil, the Unconditioned, the Blissful.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 403: Him I call a brahmana, who is wise and is profound in his knowledge, who knows the right way from the wrong way, and who has attained the highest goal (i.e., arahatship).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 419: Him I call a brahmana, who knows the death and rebirth of beings in every detail, who is detached, who follows the good practice and knows the Four Noble Truths.

          <li>The Story of Adhimanika Bhikkhus: There, when they saw the putrid corpses they could look at them as just
            skeletons, and bones, but when they saw some fresh dead bodies they realized, with horror, that they still
            had some sensual desires awakening in them. The Buddha saw them from his perfumed chamber and sent forth the
            radiance; then he appeared to them and said, "Bhikkhus! Seeing these bleached bones, is it proper for you to
            have any sensual desire in you?"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 157: If one knows that one is dear to oneself, one should protect oneself well. During
            any of the three watches (of life) the wise man should be on guard (against evil).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 166: For the sake of another's benefit, however great it may be, do not neglect one's own
            (moral) benefit. Clearly perceiving one's own benefit one should make every effort to attain it. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 170: If a man looks at the world (i.e., the five khandhas) in the same way as one looks
            at a bubble or a mirage, the King of Death will not find him. </li>
          <li>The Story of Visakha: So she went to the Buddha; when the Buddha saw her, he said, "Visakha, don't you realize that many people die in Savatthi every day? If you were to regard all of them as you regard your own grandchild you would have to be endlessly weeping and mourning. Let not the death of a child affect you too much. Sorrow and fear arise out of endearment."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 231: Guard against evil deeds, control your body. Giving up evil deeds, cultivate good deeds.
            Verse 232: Guard against evil speech, control your speech. Giving up evil speech, cultivate good speech.
            Verse 233: Guard against evil thoughts, control your mind. Giving up evil thoughts, cultivate good thoughts.
            Verse 234: The wise are controlled in deed, they are controlled in speech, they are controlled in thought. Indeed, they are perfectly self-controlled.</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Bhikkhus: Finally, they went to the Buddha to ask for his decision. The Buddha said to them, "Each of the senses is just as difficult to control as the other; but all bhikkhus must control all the five senses and not just one. Only those who control all the senses would escape from the round of rebirths."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 374: Every time he clearly comprehends the arising and the perishing of the khandhas, he finds joy and rapture. That, to the wise, is the way to Nibbana (the Deathless).</li>
          <li>The Story of a Brahmin Recluse: So he went to the Buddha and posed the question why he should not be called a pabbajita.

            not a disadvantage. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Brahmin Anatthapucchaka: Further, the Buddha asked the brahmin how he earned his living,
            and the brahmin replied that he earned his living by playing dice, i.e., by gambling. Next, the Buddha asked
            him whether he won or lost. When the brahmin answered that he sometimes lost and sometimes won, the Buddha
            said to him, "To win in a game of dice is nothing compared to a victory over moral defilements."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 109: For one who always respects and honours those who are older and more virtuous, four
            benefits, viz., longevity, beauty, happiness and strength, will increase. </li>
          <li>The Story of Ayuvaddhanakumara: When the child grew up, he went about the country with a company of five
            hundred fellow devotees. One day, they came to the Jetavana monastery, and the bhikkhus, recognizing him,
            asked the Buddha, "For beings, is there any means of gaining longevity?" To this question the Buddha
            answered, "By respecting and honouring the elders and those who are wise and virtuous, one would gain not
            only longevity, but also beauty, happiness and strength."</li>
          <li>The Story of Culekasataka: When the bhikkhus heard about this, they asked the Buddha, "How is it that, in
            the case of this brahmin, a good deed done at present bears fruit immediately?" To them the Buddha replied
            "If the brahmin had offered his outer garment in the first watch of the night, he would have been rewarded
            with sixteen of each kind; if he had made his offering during the middle watch, he would have been rewarded
            with eight of each kind; since he had made his offering only during the last watch of the night, he was
            rewarded with only four of each kind." So, when one wants to give in charity, one should do so quickly; if
            one procrastinates, the reward comes slowly and only sparingly. Also, if one is too slow in doing good
            deeds, one may not be able to do it at all, for the mind tends to take delight in doing evil.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 193: It is hard to find the noblest of men; he is not born everywhere nor in every clan. To whatever clan such a wise man is born, that clan prospers. </li>

          <li>Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said,

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 46: One who knows that this body is impermanent like froth, and comprehends that it is
            insubstantial like a mirage will cut the flowers of Mara (i.e., the three kinds of vatta or rounds), and
            pass out of sight of the King of Death.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 90: For him (an arahat) whose journey is ended, who is free from sorrow and from all
            (e.g. khandha aggregates), who has destroyed all fetters, there is no more distress. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Asked by Jivaka: "Jivaka! Ever since I attained Buddhahood there has been no
            pain and distress for me."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 96: An arahat is calm in his mind, calm in his speech, and also in his deed; truly
            knowing the Dhamma, such an arahat is free from moral defilements and is unpurturbed by the ups and downs of
            life. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Three Daughters of Mara: Then, the Buddha continued, "Brahmin Magandiya, even when I saw those peerless daughters of Mara, I felt no sensual desire in me. After all, what is this body of your daughter? It is full of urine and filth; I don't like to touch it even with my foot!"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 201: Conquest begets enmity; the conquered live in misery; the peaceful live happily having renounced conquest and defeat. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 205: Having had the taste of solitude and the taste of Perfect Peace of Nibbana, one who drinks in the joy of the essence of the Dhamma is free from fear and evil. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 212: Affection begets sorrow, affection begets fear. For him who is free from affection there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him?</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 291: He who seeks his own happiness by inflicting pain on others, being entangled by bonds of enmity, cannot be free from enmity. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Bhikkhu from the Country of the Vajjis: As he looked towards the city, standing alone in the monastery, the bhikkhu felt lonely and dissatisfied with his lot. Softly, he murmured to himself, "There can be no one whose lot is worse than mine". At that instant, the spirit guarding the woods appeared to him, and said, "those beings in niraya envy the lot of the beings in the deva world; so also, people envy the lot of those who live alone in the woods." </li>
          <li>The Story on Imprisonment: To them the Buddha answered, "Bhikkhus! These bonds are nothing compared to those of craving for food and clothing, for riches and for family. Craving is a thousand times, a hundred thousand times stronger than those chains, hand-cuffs and cages. That is the reason why the wise cut off craving and renounce the world and enter the Order of the bhikkhus."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 384: When the brahmana is well-established in the two dhammas (i.e., the practice of Tranquillity and Insight Meditation), then, in that knowing one, all fetters are destroyed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 397: Him I call a brahmana, who has cut off all fetters and is fearless, who is beyond attachment and is free from moral defilements.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Certain Brahmin: To him the Buddha said, "This bhikkhu has laid down the burden (of the khandhas)." The brahmin took that to mean that his slave had become an arahat. So to make sure, he asked the Buddha whether it was true that the young bhikkhu had become an arahat, and the Buddha confirmed his statement</li>

          <li>Tsze-kung replied, "The doctrines of Wan and Wu have not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found
            among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing
            such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could
            our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there
            for
            his having a regular master?" (C.A. quote 827)</li>

            Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single gourd dish of drink,
            and
            living in his mean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow his joy
            to be affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! (C.A. quote 188)

            quote 231)</li>
          <li>Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, "Tien, what are your wishes?" Tien, pausing as he was playing
            on
            his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and "My wishes," he said, "are different
            from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen." "What harm is there in that?" said the Master; "do
            you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes." Tien then said, "In this, the last month of spring,
            with
            the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six
            or
            seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing." The
            Master heaved a sigh and said, "I give my approval to Tien." (C.A. quote 449)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung asked, saying, "Is there one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?"

      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 35: The mind is difficult to control; swiftly and lightly, it moves and lands wherever
            it
            pleases. It is good to tame the mind, for a well-tamed mind brings happiness.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 51: Just as a beautiful flower, lacking in scent, cannot give the wearer the benefit of
            its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha cannot benefit one who does not practise the
            Dhamma.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 100: Better than a thousand words that are senseless and unconnected with the realization
            of Nibbana, is a single word of sense, if on hearing it one is calmed. </li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Rupananda (Janapadakalyani): "A thorn can only be taken out with a thorn; Rupananda
            being very attached to her body and being very proud of her beauty, I must take the pride and attachment out
            of her through beauty."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 159: One should act as one teaches others; only with oneself thoroughly tamed should one
            tame others. To tame oneself is, indeed, difficult. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Attadattha: The Buddha then said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus, those who love and revere
            me should act like Attadattha. You are not paying me homage by just offering flowers, perfumes and incense
            and by coming to see me; you pay me homage only by practising the Dhamma I have taught you, i.e., the
            Lokuttara Dhamma."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Lay-Disciple: Afterwards, the Buddha and his disciples returned to the Jetavana monastery. On the way, the bhikkhus remarked that it was so surprising that the Buddha should have directed those people to feed the young man before he gave the discourse. On hearing their remarks, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! What you said is true, but you do not understand that I have come here, all this distance of thirty yojanas, because I knew that he was in a fitting condition to take in the Dhamma. If he were feeling very hungry, the pangs of hunger might have prevented him from taking in the Dhamma fully. That man had been out looking for his ox the whole morning, and was very tired and also very hungry. Bhikkhus, after all, there is no ailment which is so difficult to bear as hunger."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Son of a Butcher: So the Buddha said, "My disciple! You are getting old; but you have not made any provisions of merit for your journey to the next existence; you should now find a support for yourself."</li>
          <li>The Story of Ekudana the Arahat: To them the Buddha said. "Bhikkhus! I do not say that a bhikkhu who has learnt much and talks much of the Dhamma is one who is versed in the Dhamma, (Dhammadhara)." One who has learnt very little and knows only one stanza of the Dhamma, but fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths, and is ever mindful is the one who is truly versed in the Dhamma."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 268 & 269: Not by silence does one become a muni, if one is dull and ignorant. Like one holding a pair of scales, the wise one takes what is good and rejects what is evil. For this reason he is a muni. He who understands both internal and external aggregates is also, for that reason, called a muni</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 372: There can be no concentration in one who lacks wisdom; there can be no wisdom in one who lacks concentration. He who has concentration as well as wisdom is, indeed, close to Nibbana.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 377: O bhikkhus! As the jasmin (vassika) plant sheds its withered flowers, so also, should you shed passion and ill will.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Vakkali: As a bhikkhu, Vakkali always kept close to the Buddha; he did not care much about other duties of a bhikkhu and did not at all practise concentration meditation. So, the Buddha said to him, "Vakkali, it will be of no use to you by always keeping close to me, looking at my face. You should practise concentration meditation; for, indeed, only the one who sees the Dhamma sees me. One who does not see the Dhamma does not see me. So, you must leave my presence."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 408: Him I call a brahmana, who speaks gentle, instructive and true words, and who does not offend anyone by speech.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Other bhikkhus misunderstood Thera Sariputta's instructions, and said to the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! Thera Sariputta is still attached to material things like robes and other requisites of a bhikkhu." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! My son Sariputta has no more craving in him. He told you to bring the robes to him, so that the chances to perform meritorious deeds may not decrease for lay-disciples, and the chances to accept whatever they may properly receive may not be reduced for young bhikkhus and samaneras."</li>

          <li>The Master said, "Though a man may be able to recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with

            his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?" (C.A.

          <li>Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous (C.A. quote 52)</li>
          <li>If a minister make his own conduct correct, what difficulty will he have in assisting in government? If

          <li>The Duke Ting asked whether there was a single sentence which could make a country prosperous. Confucius

            son's
            coffin. (C.A. quote 405) The Master said, "Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has
            not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to
            get
            a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I
            should
            walk on foot (C.A. quote 406) </li>

            Tsze-kung said, "If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three
            should
            be foregone first?" "The military equipment," said the Master. (C.A. quote 469)

            Tsze-kung again asked, "If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which
            of them should be foregone?" The Master answered, "Part with the food. From of old, death has been the lot
            of an men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state. "(C.A.
            quote

          <li>Do not decline them. May you not give them away in the neighborhoods, hamlets, towns, and villages?
            (C.A.

          <li>If the calf of a brindled cow be red and homed, although men may not wish to use it, would the spirits
            of
            the mountains and rivers put it aside? (C.A. quote 183)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I
            seek
            for a good price and sell it?" The Master said, "Sell it! Sell it! But i would wait for one to offer the
            price (C.A. Quote 314)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my
            instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of
            truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong." (C.A. quote 548)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, "The mechanic, who wishes to do his work
            well, must first sharpen his tools. When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy
            among its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its scholars." (C.A. quote 647)</li>
          <li>I have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:-occupied with thinking.
            It
            was of no use. [B]etter plan is to learn. (C.A. quote 673)</li>
          <li>Perfect is the virtue which is according to the Constant Mean! Rare for a long time has been its
            practice
            among the people (C.A. quote 206)</li>
          In language it is simply required that it convey the meaning (C.A. quote 685)
          <li>Pi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master was inclined to go. (C.A. quote 736) Tsze-lu said, "Master,
            formerly I have heard you say, 'When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a superior man will
            not associate with him.' Pi Hsi is in rebellion, holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him, what
            shall be said?" (C.A. quote 737) The Master said, "Yes, I did use these words. But is it not said, that,
            if
            a thing be really hard, it may be ground without being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be
            really
            white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made black? (C.A. quote 738)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, "Who are you sir?" He answered, "I am Chung Yu."
            "Are
            you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?" asked the other. "I am," replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to
            him, "Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its
            state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better
            follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and
            proceeded with his work, without stopping. (C.A. quote 785) Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when
            the Master observed with a sigh, "It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the
            same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associated? If right
            principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state." (C.A. quote
            786)
          </li>
          <li>Tsze-lu then said to the family, "Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and
            young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between
            sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to come to
            confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the
            failure
            of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that." (C.A. quote 791)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but
            if
            it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.
            Therefore, the superior man does not practice them." (C.A. quote 807)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man.
            (C.A. quote 849)</li>
          <li>Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be
            established
            (C.A. quote 850)</li>

            evil, whether it is for his own sake or for the sake of others. He only works for his own liberation from

          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: "Bhikkhus, Sariputta's answer is simply this; he accepts the fact that
            Nibbana is realized by means of meditation on the senses, but his acceptance is due to his own personal
            realization and not merely because I have said it or somebody else has said it. Sariputta has faith in me;

Just because you are endowed with morality (sila), just because you have attained Anagami Phala, you should not be complacent and think that there is just a little more to be done; unless you have eradicated all moral intoxicants (asavas), you must not think that you have realized perfect bliss of Arahatta Fruition."</li>

          <li>The Story of Jatila, the Brahmin: But the Buddha rejected his view and said, "O brahmin, I do not call one a brahmana because he keeps his hair matted or simply because of his birth; I call one a brahmana only if he fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 414: Him I call a brahmana, who, having traversed this dangerous swamp (of passion), this difficult road (of moral defilements), the ocean of life (samsara) and the darkness of ignorance (moha), and having crossed the fourfold Flood, has reached the other shore (Nibbana); who practises Tranquility and Insight Meditation, who is free from craving and from doubt, who clings to nothing and remains in perfect peace.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 416: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has given up craving, and leaving the home-life has become a bhikkhu; who has eradicated craving and has come to the end of existence.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 423: Him I call a brahmana, who knows past existences, who sees the celestial as well as the lower worlds, who has reached the end of rebirths, who, with Magga Insight, has become an arahat and has accomplished all that is to be accomplished for the eradication of moral defilements.</li>

          <li>Tsze-yu said, "The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in
            answering and replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the
            branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as
            sufficiently taught?" (C.A. quote 815) Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, "Alas! Yen Yu is wrong.
            According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of
            prime
            importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to
            be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals
            with
            his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the
            sage
            alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?" (C.A. quote 816)</li>

            only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were
            still solicitous about this (C.A. quote 207)</li>

          <li>The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be
            known.
            The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known.
            Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may
            be known (C.A. quote 63)</li>
          <li>Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations!
            I
            follow Chau (C.A. quote 85)</li>
          <li>Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless
            to
            remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame (C.A. quote 94)</li>
          <li>At first, my way with men was to hear their words, an give them credit for their conduct. Now my way is
            to
            hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change (C.A.
            quote 149)</li>
          <li>Po-i and Shu-chi did not keep the former wickednesses of men in mind, and hence the resentments directed
            towards them were few (C.A. quote 164)</li>
          <li>Chi'i, by one change, would come to the State of Lu. Lu, by one change, would come to a State where true
            principles predominated (C.A. quote 201)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If
            there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may
            be
            compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the
            advancing with my own going forward" (C.A. quote 321)</li>
          <li>The men of former times in the matters of ceremonies and music were rustics, it is said, while the men
            of
            these latter times, in ceremonies and music, are accomplished gentlemen (C.A. quote 397)</li>
          <li>The Master was playing, one day, on a musical stone in Weil when a man carrying a straw basket passed
            door
            of the house where Confucius was, and said, "His heart is full who so beats the musical stone." (C.A.
            quote
            622) A little while after, he added, "How contemptible is the one-ideaed obstinancy those sounds display!
            When one is taken no notice of, he has simply at once to give over his wish for public employment. 'Deep
            water must be crossed with the clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up." (C.A.

            rejoices
            in both existences. He rejoices and greatly rejoices when he sees the purity of his own deeds.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 18: Here he is happy, hereafter he is happy; one who performs meritorious deeds is
            happy
            in both existences. Happily he exclaims: I have done meritorious deeds." He is happier still when he is
            reborn in a higher world (suggati).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 30: Through mindfulness (in doing meritorious deeds) Magha became king of the devas.
            Mindfulness is always praised, but negligence is always blamed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 107: For a hundred years, a man may tend the sacred fire in the forest: yet if, only for
            a moment, one pays homage to a bhikkhu who has practised Insight Development, this homage is, indeed, better
            than a hundred years of making sacrifices (in fire-worship). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 118: If a man does what is good, he should do it again and again; he should take delight
            in it; the accumulation of merit leads to happiness. </li>
          <li>The Story of Culakala Upasaka: When the Buddha was told about it, he said to Culakala, "You have been let
            off not only because the slave girls said that you were not the thief but also because you did not steal and
            was therefore innocent. Those who do evil go to niraya, but those who do good are reborn in the deva worlds
            or else realize Nibbana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 195: He pays homage to those who are worthy of veneration, whether they are the Buddhas or their disciples who have overcome obstacles (to Insight Development) and have rid themselves of sorrow and lamentation.
 

            Verse 196: The merit gained by such a person who pays homage to those who have been freed from moral defilements and have nothing to fear, cannot be measured by anyone, as this much or that much.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 219: A man who has long been absent and has returned home safely from a distance is welcomed with joy by relatives, friends and well-wishers on his return.
            Verse 220: In the same way, his good deeds will receive him who has done good when he goes from this world to the other, as relatives receive a dear one on his return.</li>
          <li>The Story of Citta, the Householder: The Venerable Ananda, seeing how Citta's riches were being replenished, asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! is it only when Citta approached you that he is blessed with all these riches? Is he similarly blessed when he goes somewhere else?" To him the Buddha replied, "Ananda, this disciple is fully endowed with faith and generosity; he is also virtuous and his reputation spreads far and wide. Such a one is sure to be revered and showered with riches wherever he goes."</li>

          <li>Yao said, "Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely
            hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue
            will
            come to a perpetual end." (C.A. quote 837)</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera Samkicca: the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, if you rob or steal and commit all sorts of
            evil deeds, your life would be useless, even if you were to live a hundred years. Living a virtuous life
            even for a single day is much better than a hundred years of a life of depravity.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 110: Better than a hundred years in the life of an immoral person who has no control over
            his senses, is a day in the life of a virtuous person who cultivates Tranquillity and Insight Development
            Practice. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 122: One should not think lightly of doing good, imagining 'A little will not affect me';
            just as a water-jar is filled up by falling drops of rain, so also, the wise one is filled up with merit, by
            accumulating it little by little. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Raised by Thera Maha Moggallana: To him the Buddha answered, "My son, why do you ask? Have you not seen for yourself and heard what the devas said? You should not have any doubt. Little deeds of merit surely lead one to the world of the devas."</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 26: The foolish and the ignorant give themselves over to negligence; whereas the wise
            treasure mindfulness as a precious jewel.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 61: If a person seeking a companion cannot find one who is better than or equal to him,
            let him resolutely go on alone; there can be no companionship with a fool. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 78: One should not associate with bad friends, nor with the vile. One should associate
            with good friends, and with those who are noble. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 79: He who drinks in the Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind; the wise man always
            takes delight in the Dhamma (Bodhipakkhiya Dhamma) expounded by the Noble Ones (ariyas). </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Angulimala: Other bhikkhus asked the Buddha where Angulimala was reborn, and when the
            Buddha replied "My son has realized parinibbana", they could hardly believe it. So they asked him whether it
            was possible that a man who had killed so many people could have realized parinibbana. To this question, the
            Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Angulimala had done much evil because he did not have good friends. But later, he
            found good friends and through their help and good advice he had been steadfast and mindful in his practice
            of the dhamma. Therefore, his evil deeds have been overwhelmed by good (i e., Arahatta Magga).</li>
          <li>The Story of the Unrivalled Alms-Giving: On seeing the king, the Buddha said, "Great King! You should
            rejoice that you have succeeded in making the offering of the unrivalled charity (asadisadana). Such an
            opportunity comes very rarely; it comes only once during the appearance of each Buddha. But your minister
            Kala had felt that it was a waste, and was not at all appreciative. So, if I had given a lengthy discourse,
            he would get more and more dissatisfied and uncomfortable, and in consequence, he would suffer much more in
            the present existence as well as in the next. That was why I preached so briefly."
            Then the Buddha added, "Great King! Fools do not rejoice in the charities given by others and go to the
            lower worlds. The wise rejoice in other people's charities and through appreciation, they share in the merit
            gained by others and go to the abode of the devas".</li>
          <li>The Story of Nandiya: To him the Buddha said, "My son, why do you ask? Have you not yourself seen the mansion and riches waiting for Nandiya in the Tavatimsa deva world? The devas await the coming of the good and generous ones, as relatives await the return of one who is long absent. When the good ones die, they are welcomed joyously to the abode of the devas."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 328: If one finds a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one should live with him joyfully and mindfully, overcoming all dangers.
            Verse 329: If one cannot find a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one should live alone like the king who gave up and left the country he had won, and like the elephant Matanga roaming alone in the forest.    
            Verse 330: It is better to live alone; there is no fellowship with a fool. So one should live alone, do no evil, and be carefree like the elephant Matanga roaming alone in the forest.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 331: It is good to have friends when the need arises; it is good to be content with anything that is available; it is good to have merit when life is about to end; it is good to be rid of all dukkha.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 354: The gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts; the taste of the Dhamma excels all tastes; delight in the Dhamma excels all delights. The eradication of Craving (i.e., attainment of arahatship) overcomes all ills (samsara dukkha).</li>
          <li>The Story of the Questions Raised by Sakka: At the end of the discourse, Sakka said to the Buddha, "Venerable Sir, if the gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts why are we not invited to share the merit whenever gifts of the Dhamma are made? Venerable Sir! I pray that, from now on, we may be given a share in the merit of good deeds".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 376: Associate with good friends, who are energetic and whose livelihood is pure; let him be amiable and be correct in his conduct. Then, (frequently) feeling much joy he will make an end of dukkha (of the round of rebirths).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 379: O bhikkhu, by yourself exhort yourself, and examine yourself; thus guarding yourself and being mindful, you will live in peace.
            Verse 380: One indeed is one's own refuge, (how could anyone else be one's refuge?) One indeed is one's own heaven; therefore, look after yourself as a horse dealer looks after a thoroughbred.</li>

          <li>The philosopher Tsang said, "The superior man on grounds of culture meets with his friends, and by

          <li>There are three friendships which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. Friendship with the

            friendship with the glib-tongued:-these are injurious (C.A. quot 706)</li>
          <li>There are three things men find enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they find
            enjoyment
            in which are injurious. To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find
            enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends:-these
            are
            advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to
            find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:-these are injurious (C.A. quote 707)</li>
          <li>Ch'an K'ang asked Po-yu, saying, "Have you heard any lessons from your father different from what we
            have
            all heard?" (C.A. quote 718) Po-yu replied, "No. He was standing alone once, when I passed below the hall
            with hasty steps, and said to me, "Have you learned the Odes?' On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, If you
            do
            not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with.' I retired and studied the Odes. (C.A. quote
            719)
            Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and
            said to me, 'Have you learned the rules of Propriety?' On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, "If you do not
            learn the rules of Propriety, your character cannot be established.' I then retired, and learned the rules
            of Propriety. (C.A. quote 720) I have heard only these two things from him. (C.A. quote 721) Ch'ang K'ang
            retired, and quite delighted, said, "I asked one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about
            the
            Odes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also heard that the superior man maintains a
            distant
            reserve towards his son." (C.A. quote 722)</li>

            'Associate with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do so." Tsze-chang
            observed,
            "This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears
            with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?-who
            is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from

            to the value of a thousand Kahapanas; yet if, only for a moment one pays homage to a bhikkhu who has

            beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent
            without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who
            will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of
            covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not
            dare
            to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his
            clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with
            awe;-is
            not this to be majestic without being fierce?" (C.A. quote 848)</li>
          <li>Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, "What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the
            good of the principled?" Confucius replied, "Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use
            killing
            at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be good. The relation between
            superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind
            blows across it." (C.A. quote 489)</li>

            arrows for her husband when he goes out hunting?" To this question the Buddha answered, "Bhikkhus, the

            can protect you and guide you. Throughout this round of existences (samsara), the amount of tears you have
            shed on account of the death of your sons, husbands, parents and brothers is voluminous; it is even more
            than the waters of the four oceans."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 309: Four misfortunes befall a man who is unmindful of right conduct and commit sexual misconduct with another man's wife: acquisition of demerit, disturbed sleep, reproach, and suffering in niraya.
            Verse 310: Thus, there is the acquisition of demerit, and there is rebirth in the evil apaya realms. The enjoyment of a scared man with a scared woman is short-lived, and the king also metes out severe punishment. Therefore, a man should not commit misconduct with another man's wife.</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 37: The mind wanders far and moves about alone: it is non-material; it lies in the cave
            (chamber) of the heart. Those who control their mind will be free from the bonds of Mara.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 40: Knowing that this body is (fragile) like an earthern jar, making one's mind secure
            like a fortified town, one should fight Mara with the weapon of Knowledge. (After defeating Mara) one
            should
            still continue to guard one's mind, and feel no attachment to that which has been gained (i.e., jhana
            ecstasy and serenity gained through meditation).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 27: Therefore, one should not be negligent, nor be addicted to sensual pleasures; for
            he
            who is established in mindfulness, through cultivation of Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice,
            experiences supreme happiness (i.e., realizes Nibbana)./li>

          <li>The Story of a Woman: The Buddha saw him from his monastery, and with his supernormal power, sent rays of
            light to him, and the bhikkhu received this message, which said, "My son, where worldlings seek sensual
            pleasures is not the place for bhikkhus; bhikkhus should take delight in forests where worldlings find no
            pleasure."</li>
          <li>The Story of Khanu-Kondanna: "To live for a hundred years in ignorance, doing foolish things, is useless;
            now that you have seen the Truth and have become wise, your life of one day as a wise man is much more
            worthwhile.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Pilotikatissa: But the Buddha refuted them, and said, "Bhikkhus! Pilotikatissa is not
            telling lies, he speaks the truth. Though he had relationship with his teacher previously, now he has no
            relationship whatsoever with his teacher. Thera Pilotikatissa has instructed himself to differentiate right
            and wrong causes and to discern the true nature of things. He has now become an arahat, and so there is no
            further connection between him and his teacher."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 155: They, who in youth have neither led the life of Purity nor have acquired wealth,
            waste away in dejection like decrepit herons on a drying pond deplete of fish.
            Verse 156: They, who in youth have neither led the Life of Purity nor have acquired wealth, lie helplessly
            like arrows that have lost momentum, moaning and sighing after the past.</li>

            Dhammapada Verse 167: Do not follow ignoble ways, do not live in negligence, do not embrace wrong views, do not be the
            one to prolong samsara (lit., the world).</li>
          <li>
            The Story of a Young Bhikkhu: The Buddha knew that the bhikkhu was then in a receptive mood and so he said, "To smile
            with sensual desire is ignoble; it is not right and proper to have ignoble thoughts."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 167: Do not follow ignoble ways, do not live in negligence, do not embrace wrong views,
            do not be the one to prolong samsara (lit., the world). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 206: It is good to see the Noble Ones (ariyas); to live with them is always a pleasure; not seeing fools is also always a pleasure.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Man Whose Wife Committed Adultery: On learning the reason for his absence, the Buddha said, "My disciple, women are just like a river, or a road, or a liquor shop or a rest house, or a water-pot stand at the roadside; they associate with all sorts of people. Indeed, sexual misconduct is the cause of ruin for a woman."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 280: The idler who does not strive when he should be striving, who though young and strong is given to idleness, whose thoughts are weak and wandering, will not attain Magga Insight which can only be perceived by wisdom. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa the Idle One: On hearing about the above incident the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, one who does not strive when he should be striving but idle away his time will not attain mental absorption (jhana) and Magga Insight."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 281: One should be careful in speech, be well-restrained in mind, and physically, too, one should do no evil. One should purify these three courses of action and accomplish the practice of the Path of Eight Constituents made known by the Buddhas. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 332: In this world it is good to be dutiful to one's mother; also it is good to be dutiful to one's father. In this world it is good to minister unto samanas1; also it is good to minister unto brahmanas2.</li>
          <li>The Story of Culadhanuggaha, the Skilful Archer: The Buddha called the young bhikkhu to his presence and said to him, "My son, listen to me. This young woman will be your undoing just as she had been to you in a previous existence. In one of your previous existences you were a very skilful archer and she was your wife. On one occasion, while the two of you were travelling, you came upon a gang of highwaymen. She fell in love with the gang leader. So, while you and the gang leader were engaged in fighting and you called out to her to give you the sword, she gave the sword to the robber who promptly killed you. Thus, she was the cause of your death. Now, too, she will be the cause of your ruin if you go after her and leave my Order for her sake."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 371: O Bhikkhu, mediate, and do not be unmindful; do not let your mind rejoice in sensual pleasures. Do not be unmindful and swallow the (hot) lump of iron; as you burn (in niraya) do not cry, "This, indeed, is suffering."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 382: A bhikkhu who, though young, devotes himself to the Teaching of the Buddha lights up the world, as does the moon freed from a cloud.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 383: O Brahmana, cut off the stream of craving with diligence, and abandon sense desires. O Brahmana, perceiving the cessation of the conditioned, be an arahat who realizes Nibbana, the Unconditioned.</li>

            A youth when at home should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and
            truthful. He should overfow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and
            opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies (C.A. quote 9)

            incline
            to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and
            should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur (C.A. quote 124)</li>
          <li>While his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance. If he does go abroad, he must have

          <li>There are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not

            guards

            benevolent without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity. There is the
            love of knowing without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to dissipation of the mind. There
            is
            the love of being sincere without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to an injurious
            disregard
            of consequences. There is a love of straightforwardness without the love of learning;-the beclouding here
            leads to rudeness. There is the love of boldness without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads
            to
            insubordination. There is the love of firmness without the love of learning;-the beclouding here leads to
            extravagant conduct.” (C.A. quote 742) The Master said, “My children, why do you not study the Book of
            Poetry? (C.A. quote 743) The Odes serve to stimulate the mind. (C.A. quote 744) They may be used for
            purposes of self-contemplation. (C.A. quote 745) They teach the art of sociability. (C.A. quote 746) They
            show how to regulate feelings of resentment (bitter indignation at having been treated unfairly) (C.A.
            quote
            747). From them you learn the more immediate duty of serving one’s father, and the remoter one of serving

            "Gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you are grave, you will not be
            treated with disrespect. If you are generous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose (a
            state of rest, sleep, or tranquility) trust in you. If you are earnest, you will accomplish much. If you
            are
            kind, this will enable you to employ the services of others. (C.A. quote 735) </li>

          <li>The Story of the Boa Constrictor Peta: The Buddha also said he himself had also seen that very peta soon
            after he had attained Buddhahood, but that he did not say anything about it because people might not believe
            him and thus they would be doing a great wrong to the Buddha. So out of compassion for these beings, the
            Buddha had kept silent. Then he continued, "Now that I have a witness in Moggallana, I will tell you about
            this boa constrictor peta. This peta was a thief during the time of Kassapa Buddha. As a thief and a
            cruel-hearted man, he had set fire to the house of a rich man seven times. And not satisfied with that, he
            also set fire to the perfumed hall donated by the same rich man to Kassapa Buddha, while Kassapa Buddha was
            out on an alms-round. As a result of those evil deeds he had suffered for a long time in niraya. Now, while
            serving out his term of suffering as a peta, he is being burnt with sparks of flames going up and down the
            length of his body. Bhikkhus, fools when doing evil deeds do not know them as being evil; but they cannot
            escape the evil consequences"</li>
            <li>Dhammapada Verse 305: He who sits alone, lies down alone, walks alone, in diligent practice, and alone tames himself should find delight in living in the forest. </li>
            <li>The Story of an Ex-Bhikkhu: The Venerable Mahakassapa saw his pupil as he was being led out and said to him, "My pupil, keep your mind steadfastly on a subject of meditation." As instructed, he concentrated and let himself be established in deep mental absorption. At the cemetery, while the executioners were making preparations to kill him, the ex-bhikkhu was very much composed and showed no signs of fear or anxiety. The executioners and the onlookers were awe-struck and very much impressed by the man's courage and composure and they reported about him to the king and also to the Buddha.</li>
            <li>Dhammapada Verse 347: Beings who are infatuated with lust, fall back into the Stream of Craving they have generated, just as a spider does in the web it has spun. The Wise, cutting off the bond of craving, walk on resolutely, leaving, all ills (dukkha) behind. </li>

          <li>Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of

            (C.A. quote 279)</li>
          <li>When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments
            of
            full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he
            would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily (C.A. quote 307)</li>

          <li>Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, "There
            are
            your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately
            carrying
            into practice what you hear?" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice
            what
            he heard, and the Master answered, "Immediately carry into practice what you hear." Kung-hsi Hwa said, "Yu
            asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and Yu said, 'There are your father
            and elder brothers to be consulted.' Chi'u asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he
            heard, and Yu said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Chi'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you
            for an explanation." The Master said, "Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has
            more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back."</li>


          <li>The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu, Ching-po informed Confucius of it,
            saying,
            "Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut
            Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court." (C.A. quote 617) The Master said, "If my
            principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can
            the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?" (C.A. quote 618) The Master said, "Some men of
            worth
            retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks.
            Some
            retire because of contradictory language." (C.A. quote 619) The Master said, "Those who have done this are
            seven men." (C.A. quote 620)</li>

          <li>Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was
            like
            an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When
            good
            government prevails in his state, his is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll
            his principles up, and keep them in his breast." (C.A. quote 644)</li>
          <li>When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not
            be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to
            their
            man nor to their words (C.A. quote 645)</li>



          <li>A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his
            vistors. Some one asked about him, saying, "I suppose he has made great progress." (C.A. quote 630) The
            Master said, "I observe that he fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks
            shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes
            quickly to become a man." (C.A. quote 631)</li>













          <li>Tsze-lu said, "Does the superior man esteem valor?" The Master said, "The superior man holds
            righteousness
            to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be
            guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without righteousness, will commit
            robbery."

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 22: Fully comprehending this, the wise, who are mindful, rejoice in being mindful and
            find delight in the domain of the Noble Ones (Ariyas)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 28: The wise one dispels negligence by means of mindfulness; he ascends the tower of
            wisdom and being free from sorrow looks at the sorrowing beings. Just as one on the mountain top looks at
            those on the plain below, so also, the wise one (the arahat) looks at the foolish and the ignorant
            (worldlings).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 75: Indeed, the path that leads to worldly gain is one and the Path that leads to
            Nibbana is another. Fully comprehending this, the bhikkhu, the disciple of the Buddha, should not take
            delight in worldly gain and honour, but devote himself to solitude, detachment and the realization of

            also, an arahat is unperturbed by scorn or by praise."</li>

            not show elation or depression. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 91: The mindful strive diligently (in the Tranquillity and Insight Development

            that forsake the muddy pool, they abandon all home life (i.e., all cravings). /li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 92: Arahats do not hoard (anything); when taking food they reflect well over it (i.e.,
            in accordance with the three parinnas).* They have as their object liberation from existence, that is,
            Nibbana which is Void and Signless. Their destination, like the course of birds in the air, cannot be

            the door-post he is firm; he is unperturbed by the ups and downs of life; he is serene and pure like a
            lake free from mud. For such an arahat there will be no more rebirth. </li>
          <li>The Story of a Samanera from Kosambi: The Buddha listened to him, and replied, "My son, an arahat does not
            get angry with anyone he is restrained in his senses and is perfectly calm and serene."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 171: Come, look at this world (i.e., the five khandhas), which is like an ornamented
            royal carriage. Fools flounder in this world of the khandhas, but the wise are not attached to it. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Raised by Thera Ananda: After reflecting thus, Thera Ananda went to the Buddha, and put to him the question of the noblest of men. To him the Buddha replied, "Ananda, the noblest of men is not born everywhere, he is born only among Khattiyamahasala and Brahmanamahasala, the wealthy clans of Khattiya and Brahmana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 296: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always mindful of the qualities of the Buddha.

            Verse 299: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always mindful of the component parts of the body.
            Verse 300: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, whose mind by day and by night always takes delight in being compassionate (lit., harmless).
            Verse 301: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, whose mind by day and by night always takes delight in the cultivation (of good-will towards all).

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 351: He who has attained arahatship is free from fear, free from craving, and free from moral defilements. He has cut off the thorns of existence (such as lust). This is the last existence (for him).
            Verse 352: He who is free from craving and from attachment, who is skilled in the knowledge of the significance of terms, who knows the grouping of letters and their sequence is indeed called "one who has lived his last, a man of great wisdom, a great man."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 363: The bhikkhu who controls his mouth (speech) who speaks wisely with his mind composed, who explains the meaning and the text of the Dhamma, — sweet are the words of that bhikkhu.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 378: The bhikkhu who is calm in body, calm in speech, and calm in mind, who is well-composed and has given up (lit., vomited) worldly pleasures, is called a "Tranquil One".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 385: Him I call a brahmana who has for him neither this shore (i.e., the sense-bases) nor the other shore (i.e., the sense objects), and who is undistressed and free from moral defilements1.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 386: Him I call a brahmana, who dwells in seclusion practising Tranquility and Insight Meditation and is free from taints (of moral defilements); who has performed his duties, and is free from moral intoxicants (asavas) and has reached the highest goal (arahatship).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 388: Because he has discarded evil he is called a 'brahmana'; because he lives calmly he is called a 'samana'; and because he gets rid of his impurities he is called a 'pabbajita'.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Back at the monastery, the bhikkhus told the Buddha how the Venerable Sariputta had patiently borne the scolding and abuses of his mother. To them, the Buddha said that arahats never get angry, they never lose their temper.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 400: Him I call a brahmana, who is free from anger, who practises austerity, who is virtuous and free from craving, who is controlled in his senses and for whom this body (i.e., existence) is the very last.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Uppalavanna*: In this connection, they asked the Buddha whether arahats do not enjoy sensual pleasures as they have the same physical make-up like any other people. To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Arahats do not enjoy sensual pleasures; they do not indulge in sensual pleasures, for they do not cling to objects of sense and to sensual pleasures, just as water does not cling to the lotus leaf or the mustard seed to the tip of an awl."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 402: Him I call a brahmana, who even in this existence realizes the end of dukkha (i.e., Nibbana), who has laid down the burden (of the khandhas) and who is free from moral defilements.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Khema*: Sakka asked the Buddha who that bhikkhuni was and the Buddha replied, "She is one of my pre-eminent disciples; she is known as Theri Khema. She is matchless amongst the bhikkhunis in wisdom and she knows how to differentiate the right way from the wrong way."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 407: Him I call a brahmana, from whom passion, ill will, pride and detraction have fallen off like a mustard seed from the tip of an awl.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 412: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has transcended both ties good and evil; who is sorrowless and, being free from the taints of moral defilements, is pure.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 421: Him I call a brahmana, who does not cling to the past, future and present khandha aggregates and who is free from moral defilements and attachment.</li>

            When Ch'ih was proceeding to Chi'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard

          <li>"Cautious and slow in his speech!" said Niu;-"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?" The Master said,
            "When a man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?" (C.A.
            quote
            460)</li>
          <li>Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, "The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear
            (C.A. quote 461)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, "He with whom neither slander that
            gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may
            be
            called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are
            successful, may be called farseeing." (C.A. quote 467)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to
            perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this." (C.A. quote 486)</li>
          <li>Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's
            words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be

            affable (C.A) quote 552)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in
            any way which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses
            them according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you try to
            please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his
            employment of men, he wishes to be equal to everything." (C.A. quote 554)</li>

          <li>The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxities;

          <li>Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "The cultivation of himself in
            reverential carefulness." "And is this all?" said Tzze-lu. "He cultivates himself so as to give rest to
            others," was the reply. "And is this all?" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, "He cultivates himself so
            as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao
            and
            Shun were still solicitous about this." (C.A. quote 628)</li>



          <li>The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their
            virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete (C.A. quote 646)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it
            according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This
            is
            indeed a superior man." (C.A. quote 659)</li>
          <li>The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him
            (C.A.

          <li>What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others (C.A. quote 662)</li>
          <li>The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan (C.A. quote 663)

          <li>The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words
            because of the man (C.A. quote 664)</li>
          <li>The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is
            sometimes want. So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man in anxious lest he should
            not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him (C.A. quote 674)</li>
          <li>The superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be interested with great concerns. The

          <li>The superior man is correctly firm, and not firm merely (C.A. quote 681)</li>
          <li>Therefore a superior man consider it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and
            also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in
            his words there may be nothing incorrect (C.A. quote 517)</li>
          <li>The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct (C.A. quote 130)</li>

          <li>The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the
            rules
            of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right (C.A. quote 204)</li>
          <li>There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of
            Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of the sages (C.A. quote 710)</li>
          <li>The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to
            the
            use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear
            distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his
            demeanor,
            he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be
            sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that is should be reverently careful. In regard
            to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties
            his anger may involve him in. When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness. (C.A. quote 713)
          </li>
          <li>Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil! and shrinking
            from
            it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:-I have seen such men, as I have heard such
            words (C.A. quote 714)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Has the superior man his hatreds also?" The Master said, "He has his hatreds. He hates
            those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his
            superiors.
            He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and
            determined, and, at the same time, of contracted understanding." (C.A. quote 772)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern;
            when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided." (C.A. quote
            812)

          <li>Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man,

          <li>He had four of the characteristics of a superior man-in his conduct of himself, he was humble; in
            serving

            (C.A. quote 156)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The

          <li>The Story of Thera Mahakassapa: Then the other bhikkhus said scornfully, "Mahakassapa has not

          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu like Sariputta has no anger or ill

            zealous and strenuous in the practice of Tranquillity and Insight Development, arahatship can be gained in

          <li>The Story of Bhikkhu Bahubhandika: The Buddha then said to him, "Standing there without your upper robe is
            not proper; just discarding your robe etc., does not maker you an austere bhikkhu; a bhikkhu must also
            discard his doubt."</li>

            would not have become arahats. Surely, Devadatta had tried to do them a great wrong; but you, Venerable Sir,
            are a refuge to them!" To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! In trying to reach the deva world, or in trying
            to attain arahatship, you cannot depend on others, you must work hard on your own."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Weaver-Girl: Hearing her answers, the audience thought that the young weaver was being
            very disrespectful. Then, the Buddha asked her to explain what she meant by her answers, and she explained.
            "Venerable Sir! Since you know that I have come from my house, I interpreted that, by your first question,
            you meant to ask me from what past existence I have come here. Hence my answer, 'I do not know.' The second
            question means, to what future existence I would be going from here; hence my answer, 'I do not know.' The
            third question means whether I do not know that I would die one day; hence my answer, 'yes, I do know.' The
            last question means whether I know when I would die; hence my answer, 'I do not know.

            The Buddha was satisfied with her explanation and he said to the audience, "Most of you might not understand
            clearly the meaning of the answers given by the young weaver. Those who are ignorant are in darkness, they
            are just like the blind."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 174: Blind are the people of this world: only a few in this world see clearly (with

          <li>Dhammapada Verses 271 & 272: Not only by mere moral practice, nor by much learning, nor by acquiring concentration, nor by dwelling in seclusion, nor by assuring oneself, "I enjoy the bliss of Anagami Fruition that is not enjoyed by common worldlings (puthujjanas)," should the bhikkhu, rest content without attaining the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavas) [i.e., without attaining arahatship]. </li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: The Buddha came to them in the midst of their conversation and said to them, "Bhikkhus, the path you are talking about is external to you; a bhikkhu should only be concerned with the path of the Noble Ones (ariyas) and strive to do what should be done for the attainment of the Ariya Path (Magga) that leads to the realization of the Perfect Peace (Nibbana).</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Bhaddiya, the Short One: The Buddha called their attention to the short thera and said to them, "Bhikkhus, look at that thera. He has killed both his father and his mother, and having killed his parents he goes about without any dukkha."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Woman of Jealous Disposition: So the Buddha said, "Do no evil, thinking that people will not know about it. An evil deed done in secret, when discovered, will bring much pain and sorrow; but a good deed may be done secretly, for it can only bring happiness and not sorrow."</li>
          <li>The Story of Many Bhikkhus: On learning about the hardships they had undergone during the vassa, the Buddha said to them "Bhikkhus, do not keep thinking about this or anything else; it is always difficult to have a carefree, effortless living. Just as the townsfolk guard their town, so also, a bhikkhu should be on guard and keep his mind steadfastly on his body."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 345 & 346: The wise do not say that bonds made of iron, of wood, and of hemp are strong bonds; they say that only passionate attachment to and care for gems and jewelry, children and wives are strong bonds. These drag one down (to lower planes of existence) and although they seem yielding are difficult to unfasten. The wise, cutting off this bond (of craving) and resolutely giving up sensual pleasures, renounce the world.</li>
          <li>The story of Samenra Sumana: At the congregation of the bhikkhus in the evening, the bhikkhus told the Buddha about the wonderful trip made by Samanera Sumana. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, one who practises the Dhamma vigilantly and zealously is capable of attaining supernormal powers, even though he is young."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 392: If from somebody one should learn the Teaching of the Buddha, he should respectfully pay homage to that teacher, as a brahmin worships the sacrificial fire.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Abusive Brahmin Brothers: "What do we have to kill to be able to live happily and peacefully?" and his second question was, "Killing of what dhamma do you approve of?" To these questions, the Buddha replied, " O brahmin, to be able to live happily and peacefully, one will have to kill ill will (dosa). Killing one's ill will is liked and praised by the Buddhas and the arahats." </li>
          <li>The Story of Devahita the Brahmin: After drinking the mixture there was instant relief. The brahmin then came and asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! An offering made to whom gives one the greatest benefit?" To him the Buddha said, "Brahmin! An offering made to one who has given up all evil is the most beneficial."</li>

          <li>The Story of Thirty Bhikkhus: Once, thirty bhikkhus came to pay homage to the Buddha. When they came in,
            the Venerable Ananda, who was then attending on the Buddha, left the room and waited outside. After some
            time, Thera Ananda went in, but he did not find any of the bhikkhus. So, he asked the Buddha where all those
            bhikkhus had gone. The Buddha then replied, "Ananda, all those bhikkhus, after hearing my discourse, had
            attained arahatship, and with their supernormal powers, they let travelling through space."</li>

          <li>The Story of Five Lay-disciples: Thera Ananda then asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! What are the things that prevent people from being able to take in the Dhamma?" And the Buddha replied, "Ananda, passion (raga), ill will (dosa) and ignorance (moha) are the three things that prevent people from taking in the Dhamma. Passion burns one; there is no fire like passion. The world may burn up when seven suns rise in the sky, but that happens very rarely. Passion burns always and without any break."</li>

          <li>The Story of Thera Anuruddha: To those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, do not think my son
            Anuruddha has asked his relatives and lay disciples to send rice gruel and other foods. My son the thera
            did not ask for anything; arahats do not talk about such things like food and clothing. The excessive
            amount of food brought to the monastery this morning was due to the promptings of a celestial being and
            not of a man."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Mahakaccayana: The bhikkhus were awed by Sakka paying obeisance to Mahakaccayana, but
            some bhikkhus thought that Sakka was being partial to Mahakaccayana. To them, the Buddha said, "One who is
            restrained in his senses is loved by both men and devas.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 94: The arahat whose sense-faculties are calm like horses well-tamed by the charioteer,
            who is free from pride and moral intoxicants - such an arahat is held dear even by the devas. </li>
          <li>The Story of Cincamanavika: At that instant, Sakka, king of the devas, became aware of the trouble being
            brewed at the Jetavana monastery, so he sent four of his devas in the form of young rats. The four rats got
            under the clothes of Cincamanavika and bit off the strings that fastened the wooden plank round her stomach.
            As the strings broke, the wooden plank dropped, cutting off the front part of her feet. Thus, the deception
            of Cincamanavika was uncovered, and many from the crowd cried out in anger, "Oh you wicked woman! A liar and
            a cheat! How dare you accuse our noble Teacher!" Some of them spat on her and drove her out. She ran as fast
            as she could, and when she had gone some distance the earth cracked and fissured and she was swallowed up.

            The next day, while the bhikkhus were talking about Cincamanavika, the Buddha came to them and said.
            "Bhikkhu;, one who is not afraid to tell lies, and who does not care what happens in the future existence,
            will not hesitate to do any evil."</li>
            <li>Dhammapada Verse 181: The wise who practise jhana concentration and Insight Meditation take delight in the peace of liberation from sensual pleasures and moral defilements. Such wise and mindful ones, who truly comprehend the Four Noble Truths (i.e., Arahats and Buddhas) are held dear also by the devas. </li>
            <li>Dhammapada Verse 200: Indeed we live very happily, without any anxiety (i.e., without greed, ill will and ignorance); like the Abhassara brahmas we shall live on delightful satisfaction (piti) as our food.</li>
            <li>The Story of Sakka: The bhikkhus were surprised and awe-struck to find Sakka himself attending on the Buddha. When the Buddha heard their remarks he said, "Bhikkhus! There is nothing surprising about Sakka's love and devotion to me. Once, when the former Sakka was growing old and was about to pass away, he came to see me. Then, I expounded the Dhamma to him. While listening to the Dhamma, he attained Sotapatti Fruition; then he passed away and was reborn as the present Sakka. All these happened to him simply because he listened to the Dhamma expounded by me. Indeed, bhikkhus, it is good to see the Noble Ones (ariyas); it is a pleasure to live with them; to live with fools is, indeed, painful."</li>
          <li>The Story of Licchavi Princes: On one festival day, the Buddha entered the town of Vesali, accompanied by a retinue of bhikkhus. On their way, they met some Licchavi princes, who had come out elegantly dressed up. The Buddha seeing them in full regalia said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus, those who have not been to the Tavatimsa deva world should have a good look at these Licchavi princes." The princes were then on their way to a pleasure garden. There, they quarrelled over a prostitute and soon came to blows. As a result, some of them had to be carried home, bleeding. As the Buddha returned with the bhikkhus after his meal in the town, they saw the wounded princes being carried home.
            In connection with the above incident the bhikkhus remarked, "For the sake of a woman, these Licchavi princes are ruined." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, sorrow and fear arise out of enjoyment of sensual pleasures and attachment to them."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Boys: Later, when the bhikkhus remarked that the boys were very partial to Thera Kassapa, the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus, all bhikkhus who are like my son Kassapa are liked by both devas and men. Such bhikkhus always receive ample offerings of the four requisites of bhikkhus."</li>
          <li>The Story of Kisagotami: Sakka seeing her, asked the Buddha who the lady was, and the Buddha replied, "O Sakka! She is my daughter Kisagotami. Once, she came to me in sorrow and distress through the loss of her son and I made her see the impermanent, the unsatisfactory and the non-self nature of all conditioned things. As a consequence of that she attained Sotapatti Fruition, joined the Order, and became an arahat. She is one of my eminent female disciples and is matchless in the ascetic practice of wearing robes made from rags collected from a dust heap."</li>

            Enlightenment (Bodhi nana or Sabbannuta nana) which would enable me to find him, have wandered through
            innumerable births in samsara. To be born again and again is, indeed, dukkha!

          <li>The Story of the Three Daughters of Mara: The Buddha did not accept nor did he refuse the offer, but first, he related to the brahmin how the daughters of Mara tempted him soon after his attainment of Buddhahood. To the beautiful Tanha, Arati and Raga, the daughters of Mara, the Buddha had said, "It is no use tempting one who is free from craving, clinging and passion, for he cannot be lured by any temptation whatsoever."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Buddha's Return from the Tavatimsa Deva World: As promised, the Buddha came with the six coloured rays shining forth from his body to the city-gate of Sankassanagara, on the night of the full moon day of the month of Assayuja when the moon was shining brightly. He was accompanied by a large following of devas on one side and a large following of brahmas on the other. A large gathering headed by Thera Sariputta welcomed the Buddha back to this world; and the whole town was lit up. Thera Sariputta was awed by the grandeur and glory of the whole scene of the Buddha's return. He respectfully approached the Buddha and said, "Venerable Sir! We have never seen or even heard of such magnificent and resplendent glory. Indeed, Venerable Sir, you are loved, respected and revered alike by devas, brahmas and men!" To him the Buddha said, "My son Sariputta, the Buddhas who are endowed with unique qualities are truly loved by men and devas alike</li>
          <li>The Story of the Buddha's Former Deeds: On learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus, that I have been revered so much by brahmas, devas and human beings alike and that they have made offerings on such a grand and lavish scale to me on this occasion is not due to the power I now possess; it is simply because I had done some small meritorious deeds in one of my previous existences that I now enjoy such great benefits".</li>

            possible for him to be attained to?" (C.A. quote 836)</li>
          <li>Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, "Let me use the comparison of a house
            and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever
            is
            valuable in the apartments. (C.A. quote 829)
            The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see
            the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. (C.A. quote 830) But I
            may
            assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been
            expected?" (C.A. quote 831)</li>

            (C.A. quote 338)</li>

            others from doing wrong; such a man is held dear by the good; he is disliked only by the bad.</li>
          <li>The Story of Dhamma Listeners: "Most people are attached to this world; only a very few reach the other
            shore (Nibbana)."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 99: Forests are delightful, but the worldlings find no delight in them; only those who
            are free from passion will find delight in them, for they do not seek sensual pleasures. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 116: One should make haste in doing good deeds; one should restrain one's mind from evil;
            for the mind of one who is slow in doing good tends to take delight in doing evil. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 133: Do not speak harshly to anyone; those who are thus spoken to will retort. Malicious
            talk is indeed the cause of trouble (dukkha) and retribution will come to you.
          <li>The Story of Schism in the Order: On hearing this, the Buddha reflected, "Devadatta is committing a very
            serious offence; it will send him to Avici Niraya. For a virtuous person, it is easy to do good deeds and
            difficult to do evil; but for an evil one, it is easy to do evil and difficult to do good deeds. Indeed, in
            life it is easy to do something which is not beneficial, but it is very difficult to do something which is
            good and beneficial."</li>

I cannot even conquer this boy who still smells of mother's milk. It is better that I should die." Feeling depressed and very much ashamed, the king refused to take food, and kept to his bed. The news about the king's distress spread like wild fire and when the Buddha came to learn about it, he said, "Bhikkhus! In one who conquers, enmity and hatred increase; one who is defeated suffers pain and distress."</li>

            Verse 210: Do not associate with those who are dear, and never with those who are not dear to you; not seeing the dear ones is painful, and seeing those who are not dear to you is also painful.

Only one who has overcome evil is to be called a muni."</li>

            brought and threw away the bottles. Visakha requested the Buddha to teach them the Dhamma. By that time, the
            women were getting intoxicated and felt like singing and dancing. Mara, taking this opportunity made them
            bold and shameless, and soon they were boisterously singing, dancing, clapping and jumping about in the
            monastery. The Buddha saw the hand of Mara in the shameless behaviour of these women and said to himself,
            "Mara must not be given the opportunity." So, the Buddha sent forth dark-blue rays from his body and the
            whole room was darkened; the women were frightened and began to get sober. Then, the Buddha vanished from
            his seat and stood on top of Mount Meru, and from there he sent forth white rays and the sky was lit up as
            if by a thousand moons. After thus manifesting his powers, the Buddha said to those five hundred women, "You
            ladies should not have come to my monastery in this unmindful state. Because you have been negligent Mara
            has had the opportunity to make you behave shamelessly, laughing and singing loudly, in my monastery. Now,
            strive to put out the fire of passion (raga) which is in you".</li>

The fact is that the brahmin addressed you so because he was extremely devoted to the arahats. So. my sons, you should strive hard to get rid of craving and attain arahatship."</li>

The thera consented and went up and as soon as he had entered the room, the courtesan closed the door. Then she started seducing the thera. She said to the thera, "Venerable Sir!

After our long and happy wedded life we can both leave it to enter the Order and strive our very best to attain Nibbana."

            of assassins. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! Considering that Moggallana had lived a noble life in this
            existence, he should not have met with such a death. But in one of his past existences, he had done a great
            wrong to his own parents, who were both blind. In the beginning, he was a very dutiful son, but after his

            replied, "Bhikkhus! If you judge from the good deeds he has done in this existence, he has indeed met with a
            death he does not deserve. But the fact is that he has only paid for the evil he had done in a past
            existence. In one of his previous existences, when he was a courtier in the palace of the king, he fell in
            love with another man's wife and had beaten her husband to death. Thus, evil deeds surely get one into

          <li>So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and

            are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made
            contented and tranquil (C.A. quote 699)
            Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and with your
            help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own terrirotry there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and
            separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it (C.A. quote 700) And yet he is planning these
            hostile movements within the state. -I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on

          <li>Tsze-chang then asked, "What are meant by the four bad things?" The Master said, "To put the people to

            tale
            of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without
            urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And,
            generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part
            of
            a mere official." (C.A. quote 848)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked Confucius saying, "In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may
            conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the
            four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang said, "What are meant by the five
            excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without the great
            expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining (feel or express discontent; fret);
            when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being
            proud; when he is majestic without being fierce." (C.A. quote 846) Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by
            being
            beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more
            beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent
            without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who
            will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of
            covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not
            dare
            to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his
            clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with
            awe;-is
            not this to be majestic without being fierce?" (C.A. quote 848)</li>

          <li>The Story of the Pacification of the Relatives of the Buddha: The Buddha, surveying the world with his supernormal powers, saw his relatives on both sides of the river coming out to meet in battle and he decided to stop them. All alone, he went to them by going through the sky, and stopped immediately above the middle of the river. His relatives seeing him, powerfully and yet peacefully sitting above them in the sky, hid aside all their weapons and paid obeisance to the Buddha. Then, the Buddha said to them, "For the sake of some water, which is of little value, you should not destroy your lives which are of so much value and priceless. Why have you taken this stupid action? If I had not stopped you today, your blood would have been flowing like a river by now.

Other bhikkhus reported about this to the Buddha and he said to them, "Bhikkhus! A bhikkhu who is shameless is coarse in thought, word and deed.

They are deceitful and scheming. Taking the advice of their wives they have driven me out of their houses. So, now I have got to be begging. Those sons of mine are of less service to me than this staff of mine."

          <li>The Story of Laludayi: When the Buddha was told about this incident, he said, "Laludayi had learned very little of the Dhamma; he does not recite the religious texts regularly; he has not memorized anything. Whatever little he has learned gets rusty by not reciting."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 252: It is easy to see the faults of others, but difficult to see one's own. A man broadcasts the fault; of others like winnowing chaff in the wind, but hides his own faults as a crafty fowler covers himself. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Bhaddiya: Whereupon, the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus! That person is not a samanera, he is a senior bhikkhu although he is small-built and very unassuming. I do say that one is not a thera just because he is old and looks like a thera; only he who comprehends the Four Noble Truths and does not harm others is to be called a thera."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Old Bhikkhus: The Buddha called those bhikkhus to him and said, "Bhikkhus! You all are feeling pain and sorrow because you are not free from greed, hatred, and ignorance (raga, dosa, moha), which are like a forest. Cut down this forest and you will be freed from greed, hatred and ignorance."</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera Sanu: As his mother was busy cooking his meal, the ogress, who was his mother of a past existence, thought, "If my son Sanu leaves the Order, I shall be put to shame and become a laughing stock among other ogres and devas; I must try and stop him leaving the Order." So, the young samanera was possessed by her; the boy rolled on the floor, muttering in coherently with saliva streaming out of his mouth. The mother got alarmed; neighbours came and tried to appease the spirits. Then, the ogress spoke out "This samanera wants to leave the religious Order and return to the life of a lay man; if he does so he will not be able to escape from dukkha." After saying those words, the ogress left the body of the boy and the boy became normal again.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Mahapajapati Gotami: To them the Buddha replied, "Why do you say so? I myself gave the eight garudhammas to Mahapajapati and she had learnt and practised the garudhammas as required by me. I myself am her preceptor and it is quite wrong for you to say that she has no preceptor. You should harbour no doubt whatsoever about an arahat."</li>

            so?" The Master said, "It is according to the rules of propriety,' they say. Are gems and silk all that is
            meant by propriety? 'It is music,' they say. Are hers and drums all that is meant by music?" (C.A. quote

          <li>The Master said, "If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 73: The foolish bhikkhu desires praise for qualities he does not have, precedence among
            bhikkhus, authority in the monasteries, and veneration from those unrelated to him.

            Verse 74: "Let both laymen and bhikkhus think that things are done because of me; let them obey me in all
            matters, great and small." Such being the thoughts of the fool, his greed and his pride grow.</li>

            generosity of the lay disciples by misconduct and if anyone should disobey, drive him out of the
            monastery. Do not hesitate to do as I told you, for only fools dislike being given good advice and being
            forbidden to do evil."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: "It is in the nature of the foolish to be full of sorrow and feel
            depressed when things go wrong, and to be full of gladness and feel elated when things go well. The wise,
            however, can withstand the ups and downs of life."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Son of Mahadhana: "Ananda, look at this son of a very rich man; he had lived a useless
            life, an aimless life of pleasure. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the first stage of his life
            he would have been a top-ranking rich man; or if he had become a bhikkhu, he could have been an arahat, and
            his wife could have been an anagami. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the second stage of his
            life he would have been a second rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been an anagami,
            and his wife could have been a sakadagami. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the third stage of
            his life he would have been a third rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been a
            sakadagami, and his wife could have been a sotapanna. However, because he had done nothing in all the three
            stages of his life he had lost all his worldly riches, he had also lost all opportunities of attaining any

            (overwhelmed by Craving) does to himself just what his enemy wishes him to do. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 164: The foolish man who, on account of his wrong views, scorns the teaching of
            homage-worthy Noble Ones (Ariyas) who live according to the Dhamma is like the bamboo which bears fruit for
            its own destruction. </li>

            but the wise rejoice in charity and so gain happiness in the life hereafter. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 207: He who walks in the company of fools has to grieve for a long time. Association with fools is ever painful, as living with an enemy; association with the wise is a pleasure, as living with relatives.</li>
        <li>The Story of a Group of Six Bhikkhus: When the Buddha was told about this, he said, "Bhikkhus! I do not say that one who talks much, abuses and bullies others is a wise man. Only he who is free from hatred, and harms no one is a wise man."</li>

Look at the worthlessness of the beauty of this young girl." After hearing this, Queen Khema attained Sotapatti Fruition</li>

        <li>The Story of Three Groups of Persons: The Buddha answer to the first group: "Bhikkhus, once there was a
          farmer who had an ox. The ox was very lazy and also very stubborn. It could not be coaxed to do any work; it
          would lie down chewing the cud or else go to sleep. The farmer lost his temper many times on account of this
          lazy, stubborn animal; so in anger he tied a straw rope round the neck of the ox and set fire to it, and the
          ox died. On account of this evil deed the, farmer had suffered for a long time in niraya, and in serving out
          the remaining part of his punishment, he had been burnt to death in the last seven existences."

          The Buddha's answer to the second group: "Bhikkhus, once there was a woman who had a pet dog. She used to take
          the dog along with her wherever she went and young boys of the city poked fun at her. She was very angry and
          felt so ashamed that she planned to kill the dog. She filled a pot with sand, tied it round the neck of the
          dog and threw it into the water; and the dog was drowned. On account of this evil deed that woman had suffered
          for a long time in niraya and in serving the remaining part of her punishment, she had been thrown into the
          water to drown in the last one hundred existences."

          The Buddha's answer to the third group: "Bhikkhus, once, seven cowherds saw an iguana going into a mound and
          they dosed all the seven outlets of the mound with twigs and branches of trees. After closing the outlets they
          went away, completely forgetting the iguana that was trapped in the mound. Only after seven days, they
          remembered what they had done and hurriedly returned to the scene of their mischief and let out the iguana. On
          account of this evil deed, those seven had been imprisoned together for seven days without any food, in the
          last fourteen existences."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 127: Not in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean, nor in the cave of a mountain, nor
          anywhere else, is there a place, where one may escape from the consequences of an evil deed. </li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Kondadhana: The bhikkhus then reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha sent for
          Kodadadhana and said to him, "My son, did you see any woman with the other bhikkhus that you have talked to
          them thus? You have not seen any woman with them as they have seen one with you. I see that you do not realize
          that you have been cursed on account of an evil deed done by you in a past existence. Now listen, I shall
          explain to you why you have an image of a woman following you about.

          "You were a deva in your last existence. During that time, there were two bhikkhus who were very much attached
          to each other. But you tried to create trouble between the two, by assuming the appearance of a woman and
          following one of the bhikkhus. For that evil deed you are now being followed by the image of a woman. So, my
          son, in future do not argue with other bhikkhus any more; keep silent like a gong with the rim broken off and
          you will realize Nibbana."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 137: He who does harm with weapons to those who are harmless and should not be harmed will
          soon come to any of these ten evil consequences:
          Verses 138, 139 & 140: He will be subject to severe pain, or impoverishment, or injury to the body (i.e., loss
          of limbs), or serious illness (e.g., leprosy), or lunacy, or misfortunes following the wrath of the king, or
          wrongful and serious accusations, or loss of relatives, or destruction of wealth, or the burning down of his
          houses by fire or by lightning. After the dissolution of his body, the fool will be reborn in the plane of
          continuous suffering (niraya).</li>
        <li>The Story of Bodhirajakumara: In one of their past existences, the prince and his wife were the sole
          survivors of a shipwreck. They were stranded on a deserted island, and there they lived by eating birds' eggs,
          fledglings and birds, without any feeling of remorse at any time. For that evil deed, they would not be
          blessed with any children. If they had felt even a slight remorse for their deed at any stage of their lives,
          they could have a child or two in this existence. Then turning to the prince, the Buddha said, "One who loves
          himself should guard himself in all stages of life, or at least, during one stage in his life."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 161: The evil done by oneself, arising in oneself, and caused by oneself, destroys the
          foolish one, just as a diamond grinds the rock from which it is formed. </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verses 246 & 247: He who destroys life, tells lies, takes what is not given him, commits adultery and takes intoxicating drinks, digs up his own roots even in this very life.
          Verse 248: Know this, O man! Not restraining oneself is evil; do not let greed and ill will subject you to prolonged misery.</li>
        <li>The Story of a Swine-Peta: Then the Buddha exhorted, "A bhikkhu should be calm and well-restrained in thought, word and deed."</li>
        <li>The Story of Those Who Suffered for Their Evil Deeds: On hearing the statement about those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, "During the time of Kassapa Buddha, those bhikkhus had done much evil. For those evil deeds they had suffered in niraya and now they are serving out the remaining term of suffering as petas."</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Sivali: To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! In a previous existence, Sivali was the son of a king who lost his kingdom to another king. In trying to regain their kingdom he had besieged the city on the advice of his mother. As a result, the people in the city were without food or water for seven days. It was for this evil deed that Sivali was imprisoned in his mother's womb for seven years. But now, Sivali has come to the end of all dukkha; he has realized Nibbana."</li>

    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 1: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they
          are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, 'dukkha' 3 follows him just as the wheel follows the
          hoofprint of the ox that draws the cart.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 15: Here he grieves, hereafter he grieves; the evil-doer grieves in both existences. He
          grieves and he suffers anguish when he sees the depravity of his own deeds.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 17: Here he is tormented, hereafter he is tormented; the evil-doer is tormented in both
          existences. He is tormented, and he laments: "Evil have I done." He is even more tormented when he is reborn
          in one of the lower worlds (Apaya).</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 21: Mindfulness is the way to the Deathless (Nibbana); unmindfulness is the way to Death.
          Those who are mindful do not die; those who are not mindful are as if already dead.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Seyyasaka: Then, the Buddha added, "This kind of offence can only lead to evil results in
          this world as well as in the next."</li>
        <li>The Story of an Anagami Thera: The Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Your teacher, who was an Anagami before he passed away, is now reborn in the abodes of the Brahmas (Suddhavasa Brahmaloka). He did not reveal his attainment of Anagami Magga because he felt ashamed that he had achieved only that much, and he was ardently striving to attain arahatship. Your teacher is now freed from the attachment to the sensual world (kamaloka) and would certainly rise to higher realms."</li>
        <li>The Story of the Brahmin who had been the 'Father of the Buddha': The Buddha then replied, "Bhikkhus, they called me son because I was a son or a nephew to each of them for one thousand five hundred existences in the past." </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 306: One who tells lies (about others) goes to niraya; one who has done evil and says "I did not do it" also goes to niraya. Both of them being evil-doers, suffer alike (in niraya) in their next existence.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 318: Beings who imagine wrong in what is not wrong, who do not see wrong in what is wrong, and who hold wrong views go to a lower plane of existence (duggati).
          Verse 319: Beings who know what is wrong as wrong. who know what is right as right, and who hold right views go to a happy plane of existence (suggati).</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Santakaya: It is said that lions usually go out in search of food one day and then rest in a cave for the next seven days without moving. Thera Santakaya, having been a lion in his last existence, behaved very much like a lion. He moved about very little; his moments were slow and steady; and he was usually calm and composed. Other bhikkhus took his behaviour to be very queer and they reported about him to the Buddha.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Vangisa: The Buddha, knowing their intention, instructed the bhikkhus to bring the skulls of a person reborn in niraya, of a person reborn in the animal world, of a person reborn in the human world, of a person reborn in the deva world and also of an arahat. The five were then placed in a row. When Vangisa was shown those skulls he could tell where the owners of the first four skulls were reborn but when he came to the skull of the arahat he was at a loss. </li>

        <li>The Story of Devadatta: "Once, while King Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, the future Buddha was born
          as a deer, and Devadatta was then a deer-stalker. One day, the deer-stalker saw the footprints of a deer under
          a tree. So, he put up a bamboo platform in the tree and waited with the spear ready for the deer. The deer
          came but he came very cautiously. The deer-stalker saw him hesitating, and threw some fruits of the tree to
          coax him. But that put the deer on guard; he looked more carefully and saw the deer-stalker in the tree. He
          pretended not to see the deer stalker and turned away slowly. From some distance, he addressed the tree thus:

          'O tree! You always drop your fruits vertically, but today you have broken the law of nature and have dropped
          your fruits slantingly. Since you have violated the nature law of trees, I am now leaving you for another
          tree.'

          "Seeing the deer turning away, the dear-stalker dropped his spear to the ground and said, 'Yes, you can now
          move on; for today, I have been wrong in my calculations.' The deer who was the Buddha-to-be replied, 'O
          hunter! You have truly miscalculated today, but your evil kamma will not take any mistake; it will certainly
          follow you.' Thus, Devadatta had attempted to kill me not only now but also in the past, yet he had never
          succeeded." 'Then the Buddha continued, 'Bhikkhus! Just as a creeper strangles the tree to which it clings, so
          also, those without morality, being overwhelmed by lust, are finally thrown into niraya."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 320: As an elephant in battlefield withstands the arrow shot from a bow, so shall I endure abuse. Indeed, many people are without morality.
            Verse 321: Only the trained (horses and elephants) are led to gatherings of people; the King mounts only the trained (horses and elephants). Noblest among men are the tamed, who endure abuse.
            Verse 322: Mules, thoroughbred horses, horses from Sindh, and great elephants are noble only when they are trained; but one who has tamed himself (through Magga Insight) is far nobler.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Bhikkhu Who Had Been a Trainer of Elephants: The Buddha called the ex-elephant trainer bhikkhu to him and said, "O vain bhikkhu, who is yet far away from Magga and Phala ! You do not gain anything by taming elephants. There is no one who can get to a place where one has never been before (i.e.. Nibbana) by taming elephants; only one who has tamed himself can get there."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 324: The elephant called Dhanapala, in severe must and uncontrollable, being in captivity, eats not a morsel, yearning for his native forest (i. e., longing to look after his parents). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 327: Take delight in mindfulness, guard your mind well. As an elephant stuck in mire pulls itself out, so also, pull yourself out of the mire of moral defilements. </li>
          <li>The Story of a Number of Bhikkhus: "Venerable Sir! You must have had a hard time spending the vassa all alone in this forest."
            To this, the Buddha replied,"Bhikkhus, do not say so; the elephant Palileyyaka had been looking after me all this time. He was, indeed, a very good friend, a true friend. If one has such a good friend one should stick to him; but if one cannot find a good friend it is better to stay alone."</li>
          <li>The Story of Two Brahmins: So they went to the bank of the Aciravati River and there they filled up a cart with sand. One after the other, the bullocks pulled the cart, but they only pulled in vain, because the cart, did not move and only the ropes broke off. The bhikkhus seeing this reported to the Buddha and the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus! It is easy to break off the straps which you can see with your eyes; anyone can break them or cut them. But my sons, a bhikkhu should cut the strap of ill will and the thong of craving which are within you and which bind you."</li>
          <li>The Story of Angulimala: However, they could get only four hundred and ninety-nine trained elephants and so they had to put in an untrained elephant and it was allotted to hold the umbrella over Thera Angulimala. Every one was afraid that the untrained elephant might give trouble, but when brought near Thera Angulimala it was quite docile.</li>

    <h4>The prophets on death</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>The Story of a Rich Householder: To him the Buddha said, "My disciple, death does not occur only in one place. All beings that are born must die one day; indeed, life ends in death. You must ever be mindful of the fact that life ends in death. Do not imagine that only your beloved son is subject to death. Do not be so distressed or be so shaken. Sorrow and fear arise out of affection."</li>
        <li>The Story of Mahadhana, a Merchant: Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled and the Buddha replied, "Ananda, do you see that merchant? He is thinking that he would stay here and sell his goods the whole year. He is not aware that he would die here in seven days' time. What should be done should be done today. Who would know that one would die tomorrow? We have no date fixed with the King of Death. For one who is mindful by day or by night, who is not disturbed by moral defilements and is energetic, to live for just one night is a well-spent life."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 287: The man who dotes on his children and his herds of cattle, whose mind longs for and is attached to sensual pleasures, is carried away by Death even as a sleeping village is swept away by a great flood.</li>
        <li>The Story of Kisagotami: To her the Buddha said, "Kisagotami, you think you are the only one who has lost a son. Death comes to all beings; before their desires are satiated Death takes them away."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 288: Not sons, nor parents, nor close relatives can protect one assailed by Death; indeed, neither kith nor kin can give protection.
          Verse 289: Knowing this, the wise man restrained by morality should quickly clear (the obstacles to) the Path leading to Nibbana.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: Later, the Buddha was asked by the bhikkhus why he had told them to wait for seven days before sharing out the robes of Thera Tissa. To them the Buddha replied, "My sons, Tissa had his mind attached to this particular set of robes at the time of his death, and so he was reborn as a louse and stayed in the folds of the robes. When you all were preparing to share out the robes, Tissa the louse was very much in agony and was running about to and fro in the folds of the robes. If you had taken the robes at that time Tissa the louse would have felt very bitter against you and he would have to go to niraya. But now, Tissa has been reborn in the Tusita deva world, and that is why I have allowed you to take the robes. Indeed, bhikkhus, attachment is very dangerous; as rust corrodes iron from which it is formed, so also, attachment destroys one and sends one to niraya. A bhikkhu should not indulge too much in the use of the four requisites or be very much attached to them."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 334: In a man who is unmindful craving grows like a creeper. He runs from birth to birth, like a monkey seeking fruits in the forest.
          Verse 335: In this world, sorrow grows in one who is overwhelmed by this vile craving that clings to the senses, just as well-watered birana grass grows luxuriantly.
          Verse 336: In this world, sorrow falls away from one who overcomes this vile craving that is difficult to get rid of, just as water drops fall away from a lotus leaf.
          Verse 337: Therefore, I will deliver this worthy discourse to all of you who have assembled here. Dig up the root of craving just as one who wishes to have the fragrant root digs up the birana grass. Do not let Mara destroy you again and again, as the flood destroys the reed.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 338: Just as a tree with roots undamaged and firm grows again even though cut down, so also, if latent craving is not rooted out, this dukkha (of birth, ageing and death) arises again and again.
          Verse 339: That man of wrong views, in whom the thirty-six streams (of craving) that flow towards pleasurable objects are strong, is carried away by his many thoughts connected with passion.          
          Verse 340: The stream of craving flows towards all sense objects; the creeper of craving arises (at the six sense-doors) and fixes itself (on the six sense objects). Seeing that creeper of craving growing, cut off its roots with Magga Insight.
          Verse 341: In beings, there flows happiness that is smeared with craving; those beings attached to pleasure and seeking pleasure are, indeed, subject to birth and ageing.
          Verse 342: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare; held fast by fetters and bonds they undergo dukkha (round of rebirths) again and again, for a long time. 
          Verse 343: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare. Therefore, One who wishes to free himself from craving should eradicate craving.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 367: He who does not take the mind-and-body aggregate (nama-rupa) as "I and mine", and who does not grieve over the dissolution (of mind and body) is, indeed, called a bhikkhu.</li>
        <li>The Story of a Brahmin: When he told the Buddha about this, the Buddha replied to him, "O brahmin! I do not call him a brahmana just because he is born of brahmin parents. I call him a brahmana only if he is free from moral defilements and cut off all clinging to existence."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 404: Him I call a brahmana, who associates not with the householder or with the homeless one, or with both, who is free from sensual desire and has few wants.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Jatila: Some time afterwards, the bhikkhus asked Jatila whether he was still attached to his mound of gold and his sons, and he answered that he had no more attachment to them. The bhikkhus then said to the Buddha that Jatila was falsely claiming to have attained arahatship. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! Jatila has got rid of craving and pride; he has indeed attained arahatship."</li>
