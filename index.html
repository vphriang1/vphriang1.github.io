      <h4>The prophets on faithfulness</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>The Story of Uttara the Lay-Disciple: The Buddha then said, "Well done, well done, Uttara! By not bearing
            any ill will you have been able to conquer one who has done you wrong through hate. By not abusing, you
            should conquer one who abuses you; by being generous you should conquer one who is stingy; by speaking the
            truth you should conquer one who tells lies."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Dhammarama: The Buddha was satisfied and was very pleased with the explanation and
            conduct of Dhammarama and he said, "My son, Dhammarama, you have done very well. A bhikkhu who loves and
            respects me should act like you. Those who made offerings of flowers, scents and incense to me are not
            really paying me homage. Only those who practise the Dhamma are the ones who truly pay homage to me."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 415: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has given up sensual pleasures, and
            leaving the home-life has become a bhikkhu; who has eradicated sensual desires and has come to the end of
            existence.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such
            a relaxation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of
            K'wang do to me? (C.A. quote 301)</li>
          <li>My friends, why are you distressed by our master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the
            principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with it's wooden tongue (C.A.
            quote 99)</li>
          <li>Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is
            perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will
            ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?"
            (C.A. quote 455)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said to him, "There is the following saying which I have heard-'Death and life have their
            determined appointment; riches and honors depend upon Heaven.' (C.A. quote 465)</li>
          <li>The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot
            be taken from him (C.A. quote 327)</li>
          <li>He revived states that had been extinguished, restored whose line of succession had been broken, and
            called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the
            people turned towards him. (C.A. quote 843)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Genesis 22-2, ..., 5: And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
          </li>
          <li>Genesis 24-51, 52: Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.</li>
          <li>Genesis 37-36: And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.</li>
          <li>Genesis 39-8, 9, 10: But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</li>
          <li>Genesis 47-29, 30, 31: And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.</li>
          <li>Genesis 48-1, ..., 7: And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</li>
          <li>Exodus 4-25, 26: Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.</li>
          <li>Exodus 7-3, 4, 5: And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.</li>
          <li>Exodus 12-43, ..., 51: And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</li>
          <li>Exodus 22-26, 27: If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</li>
          <li>Exodus 24-3: And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.</li>
          <li>Exodus 30-33: Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.</li>
          <li>Exodus 30-37, 38: And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.</li>
          <li>Exodus 33-15: And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</li>
          <li>Exodus 40-16: Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.</li>
          <li>Leviticus 8-35, 36: Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded. So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Quran 2-40:  O children of Israel!1 Remember My favours upon you. Fulfil your covenant and I will fulfil Mine, and stand in awe of Me ˹alone˺. 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-135: The Jews and Christians each say, “Follow our faith to be ˹rightly˺ guided.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “No! We follow the faith of Abraham, the upright—who was not a polytheist.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-155: We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure-</li>
          <li>Quran 2-156: who, when faced with disaster, say, "Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we will all return</li>
          <li>Quran 2-218: Surely those who have believed, emigrated, and struggled in the Way of Allah—they can hope for Allah’s mercy. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-249: When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he and the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is ˹always˺ with the steadfast.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-285: The Messenger ˹firmly˺ believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They ˹all˺ believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers. ˹They proclaim,˺ “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. ˹We seek˺ Your forgiveness, our Lord! And to You ˹alone˺ is the final return.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-76: Absolutely! Those who honour their trusts and shun evil—surely Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-144: Muḥammad is no more than a messenger; other messengers have gone before him. If he were to die or to be killed, would you regress into disbelief? Those who do so will not harm Allah whatsoever. And Allah will reward those who are grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-146: ˹Imagine˺ how many devotees fought along with their prophets and never faltered despite whatever ˹losses˺ they suffered in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken or give in! Allah loves those who persevere. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-172: ˹As for˺ those who responded to the call of Allah and His Messenger after their injury,1 those of them who did good and were mindful ˹of Allah˺ will have a great reward. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-173: Those who were warned, “Your enemies have mobilized their forces against you, so fear them,” the warning only made them grow stronger in faith and they replied, “Allah ˹alone˺ is sufficient ˹as an aid˺ for us and ˹He˺ is the best Protector.” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-35: If you anticipate a split between them, appoint a mediator from his family and another from hers. If they desire reconciliation, Allah will restore harmony between them. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-66: If We had commanded them to sacrifice themselves or abandon their homes, none would have obeyed except for a few. Had they done what they were advised to do,1 it would have certainly been far better for them and more reassuring, </li>
          <li>Quran 4-74: Let those who sacrice this life for the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. And whoever fights in Allah's cause-whether they achieve martydom or victory-We will honour them with a great reward.</li>
          <li>Quran 5-84: Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? And we long for our Lord to include us in the company of the righteous.” </li>
          <li>Quran 5-101: O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you, may disturb you. But if you inquire about what is being revealed in the Quran, it will be made clear to you. Allah has forgiven what was done ˹in the past˺.1 And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-151: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Come! Let me recite to you what your Lord has forbidden to you: do not associate others with Him ˹in worship˺. ˹Do not fail to˺ honour your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for you and for them. Do not come near indecencies, openly or secretly. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right.1 This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will understand. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-161: And ˹remember˺ when it was said to them, “Enter this city ˹of Jerusalem˺ and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, ˹and˺ We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-163: Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath.1 During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-170: As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-18: As such, Allah frustrates the evil plans of the disbelievers.</li>
          <li>Quran 8-24: O believers! Respond to Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah stands between a person and their heart, and that to Him you will all be gathered. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-16: Do you ˹believers˺ think that you will be left without Allah proving who among you ˹truly˺ struggles ˹in His cause˺ and never takes trusted allies other than Allah, His Messenger, or the believers? And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-23: O believers! Do not take your parents and siblings as trusted allies if they choose disbelief over belief. And whoever of you does so, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-51: Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except what Allah has destined for us. He is our Protector.” So in Allah let the believers put their trust. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-86: Whenever a sûrah is revealed stating, “Believe in Allah and struggle along with His Messenger,” the rich among them would ask to be exempt, saying, “Leave us with those who remain behind.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-92: Nor ˹is there any blame on˺ those who came to you ˹O Prophet˺ for mounts, then when you said, “I can find no mounts for you,” they left with eyes overflowing with tears out of grief that they had nothing to contribute. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-120: It was not ˹proper˺ for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs around them to avoid marching with the Messenger of Allah or to prefer their own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of Allah; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-109: And follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah passes His judgment. For He is the Best of Judges. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-75: Truly, Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, and ever turning ˹to his Lord˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-24: She advanced towards him, and he would have done likewise, had he not seen a sign from his Lord.1 This is how We kept evil and indecency away from him, for he was truly one of Our chosen servants. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-34: So his Lord responded to him, turning their cunning away from him. Surely He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-38: I follow the faith of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not ˹right˺ for us to associate anything with Allah ˹in worship˺. This is part of Allah’s grace upon us and humanity, but most people are not grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-64:  He responded, “Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother ˹Joseph˺? But ˹only˺ Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.” 
          <li>Quran 14-37: Our Lord! I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley, near Your Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may establish prayer. So make the hearts of ˹believing˺ people incline towards them and provide them with fruits, so perhaps they will be thankful. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-4: saying, “My Lord! Surely my bones have become brittle, and grey hair has spread across my head, but I have never been disappointed in my prayer to You, my Lord! </li>
          <li>Quran 21-49: who are in awe of their Lord without seeing Him,1 and are fearful of the Hour. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-62: The ˹true˺ believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him on a public matter, they do not leave without his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission ˹O Prophet˺ are the ones who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for a private matter, grant permission to whoever you wish and ask Allah’s forgiveness for them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-36: It is not for a believing man or woman—when Allah and His Messenger decree a matter—to have any other choice in that matter.1 Indeed, whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly gone ˹far˺ astray.</li>
          <li>Quran 37-102, ..., 108: Then when they submitted ˹to Allah’s Will˺, and Abraham laid him on the side of his forehead ˹for sacrifice˺, Then when the boy reached the age to work with him, Abraham said, “O my dear son! I have seen in a dream that I ˹must˺ sacrifice you. So tell me what you think.” He replied, “O my dear father! Do as you are commanded. Allah willing, you will find me steadfast.” Then when they submitted ˹to Allah’s Will˺, and Abraham laid him on the side of his forehead ˹for sacrifice˺, We called out to him, “O Abraham! You have already fulfilled the vision.” Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers. That was truly a revealing test. And We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice,1 and blessed Abraham ˹with honourable mention˺ among later generations: </li>
          <li>Quran 44-23, 24: ˹Allah responded,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for you will surely be pursued. And leave the sea parted, for they are certainly an army bound to drown.”  </li>
          <li>Quran 48-9: so that you ˹believers˺ may have faith in Allah and His Messenger, support and honour him, and glorify Allah morning and evening.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 48-22: If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would certainly flee.1 Then they would never find any protector or helper. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-31, ..., 35:  And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, not far off. ˹And it will be said to them,˺ “This is what you were promised, for whoever ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺ and kept up ˹His commandments˺— who were in awe of the Most Compassionate without seeing ˹Him˺,1 and have come with a heart turning ˹only to Him˺. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of eternal life!” There they will have whatever they desire, and with Us is ˹even˺ more.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 57-27: Then in the footsteps of these ˹prophets˺, We sent Our messengers, and ˹after them˺ We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and granted him the Gospel, and instilled compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. As for monasticism, they made it up—We never ordained it for them—only seeking to please Allah, yet they did not ˹even˺ observe it strictly. So We rewarded those of them who were faithful. But most of them are rebellious. </li>
          <li>Quran 58-22: You will never find a people who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day loyal to those who defy Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, children, siblings, or extended family. For those ˹believers˺, Allah has instilled faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him.1 He will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Indeed, Allah’s party is bound to succeed. </li>
          <li>Quran 66-5: Perhaps, if he were to divorce you ˹all˺, his Lord would replace you with better wives who are submissive ˹to Allah˺, faithful ˹to Him˺, devout, repentant, dedicated to worship and fasting—previously married or virgins. </li>
          <li>Quran 66-10: Allah sets forth an example for the disbelievers: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. Each was married to one of Our righteous servants, yet betrayed them.1 So their husbands were of no benefit to them against Allah whatsoever. Both were told, “Enter the Fire, along with the others!” </li>
          <li>Quran 66-11: And Allah sets forth an example for the believers: the wife of Pharaoh, who prayed, “My Lord! Build me a house in Paradise near You, deliver me from Pharaoh and his ˹evil˺ doing, and save me from the wrongdoing people.” </li>
          <li>Quran 68-48: So be patient with your Lord’s decree, and do not be like ˹Jonah,˺ the Man of the Whale, who cried out ˹to Allah˺, in total distress.1</li>
          <li>Quran 70-32, ..., 34: ˹The faithful are˺ also those who are true to their trusts and covenants; and who are honest in their testimony; and who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers. </li>
          <li>Quran 76-25, 26: ˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening, and prostrate before Him during part of the night,1 and glorify Him long at night.2  </li>
          <li>Quran 96-8, ..., 19: ˹But˺ surely to your Lord is the return ˹of all˺.  Have you seen the man who prevents a servant ˹of Ours˺ from praying?1  What if this ˹servant˺ is ˹rightly˺ guided,  or encourages righteousness?  What if that ˹man˺ persists in denial and turns away?  Does he not know that Allah sees ˹all˺?  But no! If he does not desist, We will certainly drag him by the forelock— a lying, sinful forelock.1 So let him call his associates. We will call the wardens of Hell.  Again, no! Never obey him ˹O Prophet˺! Rather, ˹continue to˺ prostrate and draw near ˹to Allah˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 108-1, 2: Indeed, We have granted you ˹O Prophet˺ abundant goodness.1  So pray and sacrifice to your Lord ˹alone˺.</li>

          <li> Dhammapada Verse 10: He who has discarded all moral defilements (kilesas), who is established in moral
            precepts, is endowed with restraint and (speaks the) truth is, indeed, worthy of the yellow robe.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 12: They take truth for truth; they take untruth for untruth; such persons arrive at the
            truth, for they hold right views. At the end of the discourse, many people came to be established in
            Sotapatti Fruition.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada verse 20: Though he recites only a little of the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but practises
            according to the Dhamma,
            eradicating passion, ill will and ignorance, clearly comprehending the Dhamma, with his mind freed from
            moral
            defilements and no longer clinging to this world or to the next, he shares the benefits of the life of a
            bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 50: One should not consider the faults of others, nor their doing or not doing good or
            bad deeds. One should consider only whether one has done or not done good or bad deeds.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 52: Just as a flower, beautiful as well as fragrant, will give the wearer the benefit of
            its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha will benefit one who practises the Dhamma.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 84: For his own sake or for the sake of others, he does no evil; nor does he wish for
            sons

          <li>The Story of Lajadevadhita: So he told her not to come to the monastery any more, as people might start
            talking if she kept on coming to the monastery. Lajadevadhita was very upset; she pleaded with the thera and
            cried, "Please do not destroy my riches, my wealth." The Buddha heard her cries and sent forth the radiance
            from his chamber and said to the female deva, "Devadhita, it is the duty of my son Kassapa to stop your
            coming to the monastery; to do good deeds is the duty of one who is anxious to gain merit."</li>

          <li>The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to the chief criminal judge, the latter consulted

And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.

And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?

And to fast is better for you, if only you knew.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-209:  If you falter after receiving the clear proofs, then know that Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-229: Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain ˹his wife˺ with honour or separate ˹from her˺ with grace.1 It is not lawful for husbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless the couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of Allah.2 So if you fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce.3 These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. </li>

          <li>Quran 4-9: Let the guardians be as concerned ˹for the orphans˺ as they would if they were to ˹die and˺ leave ˹their own˺ helpless children behind. So let them be mindful of Allah and speak equitably. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-68: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not grieve for the people who disbelieve.</li>
          <li>Quran 5-83: When they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears for recognizing the truth. They say, “Our Lord! We believe, so count us among the witnesses. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-152: And do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Give full measure and weigh with justice. We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. Whenever you speak,1 maintain justice—even regarding a close relative. And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-188: Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-118: And ˹Allah has also turned in mercy to˺ the three who had remained behind, ˹whose guilt distressed them˺ until the earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They knew there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-15: When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say ˹to the Prophet˺, “Bring us a different Quran or make some changes in it.” Say ˹to them˺, “It is not for me to change it on my own. I only follow what is revealed to me. I fear, if I were to disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.” </li>
          <li>Quran 10-28: ˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then say to those who associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺, “Stay in your places—you and your associate-gods.” We will separate them from each other, and their associate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped! </li>
          <li>Quran 10-58: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ they amass.” </li>
          <li>Quran 10-99: Had your Lord so willed ˹O Prophet˺, all ˹people˺ on earth would have certainly believed, every single one of them! Would you then force people to become believers? </li>
          <li>Quran 11-36: And it was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will believe except those who already have. So do not be distressed by what they have been doing. </li>

          <li>Quran 13-18: Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest! </li>
          <li>Quran 14-11: Their messengers said to them, “We are ˹indeed˺ only humans like you, but Allah favours whoever He chooses of His servants. It is not for us to bring you any proof without Allah’s permission. And in Allah let the believers put their trust. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-114: Exalted is Allah, the True King! Do not rush to recite ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran ˹O Prophet˺ before it is ˹properly˺ conveyed to you,1 and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.” </li>
          <li>Quran 24-12: If only the believing men and women had thought well of one another, when you heard this ˹rumour˺, and said, “This is clearly ˹an outrageous˺ slander!” </li>
          <li>Quran 38-86, ..., 88: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹Quran˺, nor do I pretend to be someone I am not. It is only a reminder to the whole world.  And you will certainly know its truth before long.” </li>
          <li>Quran 44-38, 39: We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between for sport.  We only created them for a purpose, but most of these ˹pagans˺ do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-3: We only created the heavens and the earth and everything in between for a purpose and an appointed term. Yet the disbelievers are turning away from what they have been warned about. </li>
          <li>Quran 49-14: ˹Some of˺ the nomadic Arabs say, “We believe.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “You have not believed. But say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered your hearts.1 But if you obey Allah and His Messenger ˹wholeheartedly˺, He will not discount anything from ˹the reward of˺ your deeds. Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” </li>

          <li>The Story of Sirima: The Buddha then asked the king to get a town crier announce that Sirima would be
            available on payment of one thousand in cash per night. But no body would take her for one thousand, or for
            five hundred, or for two hundred and fifty, or even if she were to be given free of charge. Then the Buddha
            said to the audience, "Bhikkhus! Look at Sirima. When she was living, there were many who were willing to
            give one thousand to spend one night with her; but now none would take her even if given without any
            payment. The body of a person is subject to deterioration and decay."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 147: Look at this dressed up body, a mass of sores, supported (by bones), sickly, a
            subject of many thoughts (of sensual desire). Indeed, that body is neither permanent nor enduring. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 148: This body is worn out-with age, it is the seat of sickness, it is subject to decay.
            This putrid body disintegrates; life, indeed, ends in death. </li>
          <li>The Story of Queen Mallika: To him the Buddha said, "Look at these carriages of your father and your
            grandfather; these are all worn down and lying useless; so also is your body, which is subject to death and
            decay. Only the Dhamma of the Virtuous is not subject to decay."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 151: The much ornamented royal carriages do wear out, the body also grows old, but the
            Dhamma of the Virtuous does not decay. Thus, indeed, say the Virtuous among themselves. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 160: One indeed is one's own refuge; how can others be a refuge to one? With oneself
            thoroughly tamed, one can attain a refuge (i.e., Arahatta Phala), which is so difficult to attain. </li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: As soon as they entered the compound of the monastery, a storm broke
            out; as big drops of rain fell, bubbles were formed on the ground and soon disappeared. Seeing those
            bubbles, the bhikkhus reflected "This body of ours is perishable like the bubbles", and perceived the
            impermanent nature of the aggregates (khandhas).</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sammajjana: Other bhikkhus noticed some rubbish piling up in the compound and they
            asked Sammajjana why he was not sweeping as much as he used to, and he replied, "When I was not mindful, I
            was all the time sweeping; but now I am no longer unmindful." When the bhikkhus heard his reply they were
            sceptical; so they went to the Buddha and said, "Venerable Sir! Thera Sammajjana falsely claims himself to
            be an arahat; he is telling lies." To them the Buddha said, "Sammajjana has indeed attained arahatship; he
            is telling the truth."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Young Bride: By his supernormal power, the Buddha willed that the bride would not be
            visible to the bridegroom. When the young man could no longer see the young woman, he could pay full
            attention to the Buddha, and his love and respect for the Buddha grew stronger in him. Then the Buddha said
            to the young man, "O young man, there is no fire like the fire of passion; there is no evil like anger and
            hatred; there is no ill like the burden of the five aggregates of existence (khandhas); there is no bliss
            like the Perfect Peace of Nibbana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 276: You yourselves should make the effort; the Tathagatas (Buddhas) only can show the
            way. Those who practise the Tranquillity and Insight Meditation are freed from the bond of Mara.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: So they went to the Buddha and said, "Thera Tissa claims himself to be an arahat
            ; he is not speaking the truth." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, my son Tissa was speaking the truth
            when he said he did not get angry. He has indeed become an arahat he is no longer attached to anyone; he has
            no occasion to get angry with anyone nor any need to associate with others."</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Dhammadinna: His wife Dhammadinna retorted, "Who would swallow the spittle you have
            thrown up?" Then she asked permission from him to enter the Order and became a bhikkhuni. After becoming a
            bhikkhuni she went to a monastery in a small village in the company of other bhikkhunis to practise
            meditation.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-27: those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺ Allah
            has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land. It is they who are the ˹true˺ losers. </li>

          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not
            forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn." (C.A. quote 808)</li>
          <li>Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not
            lead to the instruction of its object? (C.A. quote 568)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "I would prefer not speaking." (C.A. quote 761) Tsze-kung said, "If you, Master, do not
            speak, what shall we, your disciples, have to record?" (C.A. quote 762) The Master said, "Does Heaven
            speak?
            The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say
            anything?" (C.A. quote 763)</li>

          <li>Genesis 41-15, 16: And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</li>
          <li>Exodus 16-8: And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-42: Do not mix truth with falsehood or hide the truth knowingly.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-146: Those We have given the Scripture recognize this ˹Prophet˺ as they recognize their own children. Yet a group of them hides the truth knowingly. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-230: So if a husband divorces his wife ˹three times˺, then it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and then is divorced. Then it is permissible for them to reunite, as long as they feel they are able to maintain the limits of Allah. These are the limits set by Allah, which He makes clear for people of knowledge. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-286: Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹The believers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-20: If you desire to replace a wife with another and you have given the former ˹even˺ a stack of gold ˹as a dowry˺, do not take any of it back. Would you ˹still˺ take it unjustly and very sinfully? </li>
          <li>Quran 4-72, 73: There will be some among you who will lag behind so that if you face a disaster, they will say, "Allah has blessed us for not being there among them." But if you resturn with Allah's bounties, they will say-as if there had been no bond between you-"We wish we had been there with them to share the great gain!"</li>
          <li>Quran 4-138: Give good news of a painful punishment to hypocrites, </li>
          <li>Quran 5-89: Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-66: Now Allah has lightened your burden, for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there be one thousand, they will overcome two thousand, by Allah’s Will. And Allah is with the steadfast.</li>
          <li>Quran 9-111: Allah has indeed purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah and kill or are killed. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. And whose promise is truer than Allah’s? So rejoice in the exchange you have made with Him. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-113: It is not ˹proper˺ for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were close relatives, after it has become clear to the believers that they are bound for the Hellfire. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-29: Allah is sufficient as a Witness between each of us that we were totally unaware of your worship.”</li>
          <li>Quran 11-13: Or do they say, “He1 has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-88: He said, “O my people! Consider if I stand on a clear proof from my Lord and He has blessed me with a good provision from Him. I do not want to do what I am forbidding you from. I only intend reform to the best of my ability. My success comes only through Allah. In Him I trust and to Him I turn. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-29: O  Joseph! Forget about this. And you ˹O wife˺! Seek forgiveness for your sin.1 It certainly has been your fault.” 
          <li>Quran 12-39: O  my fellow-prisoners! Which is far better: many different lords or Allah—the One, the Supreme? </li>
          <li>Quran 12-51: The King asked ˹the women˺, “What did you get when you tried to seduce Joseph?” They replied, “Allah forbid! We know nothing indecent about him.” Then the Chief Minister’s wife admitted, “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely truthful. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-53: And I do not seek to free myself from blame, for indeed the soul is ever inclined to evil, except those shown mercy by my Lord. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-89: ˹Consider, O  Prophet,˺ the Day We will call against every faith-community a witness of their own. And We will call you to be a witness against these ˹people of yours˺. We have revealed to you the Book as an explanation of all things, a guide, a mercy, and good news for those who ˹fully˺ submit. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-56: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Invoke those you claim ˹to be divine˺1 besides Him—they do not have the power to undo harm from you or transfer it ˹to someone else˺.”</li>
          <li>Quran 19-65: ˹He is the˺ Lord of the heavens, and the earth, and everything in between. So worship Him ˹alone˺, and be steadfast in His worship. Do you know of anyone equal to Him ˹in His attributes˺?” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-48: It has indeed been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies ˹the truth˺ and turns away.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-6: That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth, He ˹alone˺ gives life to the dead, and He ˹alone˺ is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-14: Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you in this world and the Hereafter, you would have certainly been touched with a tremendous punishment for what you plunged into— </li>
          <li>Quran 24-15: when you passed it from one tongue to the other, and said with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, taking it lightly while it is ˹extremely˺ serious in the sight of Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-165, ... 174: Why do you ˹men˺ lust after fellow men,1  leaving the wives that your Lord has created for you? In fact, you are a transgressing people.”  They threatened, “If you do not desist, O  Lot, you will surely be expelled.” Lot responded, “I am truly one of those who despise your ˹shameful˺ practice.  My Lord! Save me and my family from ˹the consequences of˺ what they do.”  So We saved him and all of his family,  except an old woman,1 who was one of the doomed.  Then We utterly destroyed the rest,  pouring upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. How evil was the rain of those who had been warned!  Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 28-44: You were not there ˹O Prophet˺ on the western side of the mountain when We entrusted the Commandments to Moses, nor were you present ˹in his time˺.1</li>
          <li>Quran 29-49: But this ˹Quran˺ is ˹a set of˺ clear revelations ˹preserved˺ in the hearts of those gifted with knowledge. And none denies Our revelations except the ˹stubborn˺ wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-57: Every soul will taste death, then to Us you will ˹all˺ be returned. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-30: That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth and what they invoke besides Him is falsehood, and ˹because˺ Allah ˹alone˺ is the Most High, All-Great. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-4: Allah does not place two hearts in any person’s chest. Nor does He regard your wives as ˹unlawful for you like˺ your real mothers, ˹even˺ if you say they are.1 Nor does He regard your adopted children as your real children.2 These are only your baseless assertions. But Allah declares the truth, and He ˹alone˺ guides to the ˹Right˺ Way. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-36: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. But most people do not know.” </li>
          <li>Quran 36-30: Oh pity, such beings! No messenger ever came to them without being mocked. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-30: You ˹O Prophet˺ will certainly die, and they will die too. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-30: And the man who believed cautioned, “O my people! I truly fear for you the doom of ˹earlier˺ enemy forces— </li>
          <li>Quran 41-41, 42: Indeed, those who deny the Reminder1 after it has come to them ˹are doomed˺, for it is truly a mighty Book.  It cannot be proven false from any angle. ˹It is˺ a revelation from the ˹One Who is˺ All-Wise, Praiseworthy. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-46: Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss. Your Lord is never unjust to ˹His˺ creation. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-53: the Path of Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Surely to Allah all matters will return ˹for judgment˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-22, 23: If the disbelievers were to fight you, they would certainly flee.1 Then they would never find any protector or helper. ˹This is˺ Allah’s way, already long established ˹in the past˺. And you will find no change in Allah’s way. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-28: He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹right˺ guidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others. And sufficient is Allah as a Witness. </li>
          <li>Quran 52-16:  Burn in it! It is the same whether you endure ˹it˺ patiently or not.1 You are only rewarded for what you used to do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 55-26, 27: Every being on earth is bound to perish. Only your Lord Himself,1 full of Majesty and Honour, will remain ˹forever˺.2</li>
          <li>Quran 62-6: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O Jews! If you claim to be Allah’s chosen ˹people˺ out of all humanity, then wish for death, if what you say is true.” </li>

And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach: And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.</li></ul>

And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them. Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD'S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-60: And ˹remember˺ when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out, ˹and˺ each tribe knew its drinking place. ˹We then said,˺ “Eat and drink of Allah’s provisions, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-103: And hold firmly to the rope of Allah1 and do not be divided. Remember Allah’s favour upon you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so you—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at the brink of a fiery pit and He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may be ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-165: Why is it when you suffered casualties ˹at Uḥud˺—although you had made your enemy suffer twice as much ˹at Badr˺—you protested, “How could this be?”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is because of your disobedience.” Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>

          <li>Quran 5-45: We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers. </li>

          <li>Quran 7-57, 58: He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy. When they bear heavy clouds, We drive them to a lifeless land and then cause rain to fall, producing every type of fruit. Similarly, We will bring the dead to life, so perhaps you will be mindful. The fertile land produces abundantly by the Will of its Lord, whereas the infertile land hardly produces anything. This is how We vary ˹Our˺ lessons to those who are thankful. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-59: If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger had given them and said, “Allah is sufficient for us! Allah will grant us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. To Allah ˹alone˺ we turn with hope.”</li>
          <li>Quran 14-34: And He has granted you all that you asked Him for. If you tried to count Allah’s blessings, you would never be able to number them. Indeed humankind is truly unfair, ˹totally˺ ungrateful.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 15-20: And We made in it means of sustenance for you and others, who you do not provide for. </li>

Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who made the earth a place of settlement, caused rivers to flow through it, placed firm mountains upon it, and set a barrier between ˹fresh and salt˺ bodies of water?1 Was it another god besides Allah?” Absolutely not! But most of them do not know. </li>

          <li>Quran 27-63, 64: Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea,1 and sends the winds ushering in His mercy?2 Is it another god besides Allah? Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺! Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who originates the creation then resurrects it, and gives you provisions from the heavens and the earth? Is it another god besides Allah?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof, if what you say is true.” </li>
          <li>Quran 31-32: And as soon as they are overwhelmed by waves like mountains, they cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion. But when He delivers them ˹safely˺ to shore, only some become relatively grateful. And none rejects Our signs except whoever is deceitful, ungrateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-32, ..., 34: And among His signs are the ships like mountains ˹sailing˺ in the sea. If He wills, He can calm the wind, leaving the ships motionless on the water. Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful. Or He can wreck the ships for what the people have committed—though He forgives much— </li>
          <li>Quran 56-62: You already know how you were first created. Will you not then be mindful? </li>

          <li>Quran 77-20, ..., 23: Did We not create you from a humble fluid,  placing it in a secure place  until an appointed time?1  We ˹perfectly˺ ordained ˹its development˺. How excellent are We in doing so! </li>
          <li>Quran 77-25, 26, 27: Have We not made the earth a lodging for the living and the dead, and placed upon it towering, firm mountains, and given you fresh water to drink? </li>
          <li>Quran 93-1, ... 8: By the morning sunlight,  and the night when it falls still!  Your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful ˹of you˺.  And the next life is certainly far better for you than this one.  And ˹surely˺ your Lord will give so much to you that you will be pleased.  Did He not find you as an orphan then sheltered you?  Did He not find you unguided then guided you?  And did He not find you needy then satisfied your needs? </li>

          <li>Quran 2-57: And ˹remember when˺ We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails,1 ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” The evildoers ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.</li>
          <li>Quran 4-79: Whatever good befalls you is from Allah and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself.1 We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a messenger to ˹all˺ people. And Allah is sufficient as a Witness. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-35: If you find their denial unbearable, then build—if you can—a tunnel through the earth or stairs to the sky to bring them a ˹more compelling˺ sign. Had Allah so willed, He could have guided them all. So do not be one of those ignorant ˹of this fact˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-42: Indeed, We have sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ to other people who We put through suffering and adversity ˹for their denial˺, so perhaps they would be humbled. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-43: Why did they not humble themselves when We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-11, 12: Surely We created you,1 then shaped you, then said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,2 who refused to prostrate with the others. Allah asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-25: Beware of a trial that will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. And know that Allah is severe in punishment. </li>

          <li>Quran 12-97: They begged, “O our father! Pray for the forgiveness of our sins. We have certainly been sinful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-40: Whether We show you ˹O Prophet˺ some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, your duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺. Judgment is for Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-5: No people can advance their doom, nor can they delay it. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-22: We send fertilizing winds, and bring down rain from the sky for you to drink. It is not you who hold its reserves.</li>

          <li>Quran 18-65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82: There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy from Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own. Moses said to him, “May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?”1 He said, “You certainly cannot be patient ˹enough˺ with me. And how can you be patient with what is beyond your ˹realm of˺ knowledge?” Moses assured ˹him˺, “You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.” He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I ˹myself˺ clarify it for you.” So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!” He replied, “Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?” Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.” So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.” He answered, “Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?” Moses replied, “If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.” So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they found a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, “If you wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.” He replied, “This is the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear patiently. “As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I intended to damage it, for there was a ˹tyrant˺ king ahead of them who seizes every ˹good˺ ship by force. “And as for the boy, his parents were ˹true˺ believers, and we1 feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief.  So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place. “And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come of age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it ˹all˺ on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently.”1  </li>
          <li>Quran 21-87, 88: And ˹remember˺ when the Man of the Whale stormed off ˹from his city˺ in a rage, thinking We would not restrain him.1 Then in the ˹veils of˺ darkness2 he cried out, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except You. Glory be to You! I have certainly done wrong.”  So We answered his prayer and rescued him from anguish. And so do We save the ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-35: those whose hearts tremble at the remembrance of Allah, who patiently endure whatever may befall them, and who establish prayer and donate from what We have provided for them. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-82: And He is ˹the One˺ Who, I hope, will forgive my flaws1 on Judgment Day.” </li>
          <li>Quran 41-50: And if We let them taste a mercy from Us after being touched with adversity, they will certainly say, “This is what I deserve. I do not think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, the finest reward with Him will definitely be mine.” But We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they used to do. And We will certainly make them taste a harsh torment. </li>
          <li>Quran 47-13: ˹Imagine, O  Prophet,˺ how many societies We destroyed that were far superior in might than your society—which drove you out—and there was none to help them! </li>
          <li>Quran 59-10: And those who come after them will pray, “Our Lord! Forgive us and our fellow believers who preceded us in faith, and do not allow bitterness into our hearts towards those who believe. Our Lord! Indeed, You are Ever Gracious, Most Merciful.” </li>

          <li>The Story of Mara: Just then, the five hundred village maidens arrived on the scene and paid obeisance to
            the Buddha. In their presence, Mara taunted the Buddha, "O Buddha, since you received no alms-food this
            morning, you must be feeling the pangs of hunger!" To him the Buddha replied, "O wicked Mara, even though we
            do not get any food, like the Abhassara brahmas who live only on the delightful satisfaction (piti) and
            bliss (sukha) of jhana, we shall live on the delightful satisfaction and bliss of the Dhamma."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 266: He does not become a bhikkhu merely because he stands at the door for alms. He
            cannot become a bhikkhu because he acts according to a faith which is not in conformity with the Dhamma.
            Verse 267: In this world, he who lays aside both good and evil, who leads the life of purity, and lives
            meditating on the khandha aggregates is indeed called a bhikkhu.</li>
          <li>The Story of Uggasena, the Son of a Rich Man*: One day, when other bhikkhus asked him whether he did not
            have any feeling of fear while climbing down from such a great height (i.e., about ninety feet), he answered
            in the negative. The bhikkhus took that to mean that Uggasena was claiming to have attained arahatship even
            then. So, they went to the Buddha and said, "Venerable Sir! Uggasena claims himself to be an arahat; he must
            be telling lies." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, one who has cut off all fetters, like my son

And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.

          <li>Quran 4-135: O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, Allah is best to ensure their interests. So do not let your desires cause you to deviate ˹from justice˺. If you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then ˹know that˺ Allah is certainly All-Aware of what you do. </li>

If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if you judge between them, then do so with justice. Surely Allah loves those who are just. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-67: O Messenger! Convey everything revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not, then you have not delivered His message. Allah will ˹certainly˺ protect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the people who disbelieve. </li>

Also, they have a charge against me,1 so I fear they may kill me.” Allah responded, “Certainly not! So go, both of you, with Our signs. We will be with you, listening. Go to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are messengers from the Lord of all worlds,  ˹commanded to say:˺ ‘Let the Children of Israel go with us.’’” </li>

And ˹remember˺ when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, “Allah and His Messenger have promised us nothing but delusion!” And ˹remember˺ when a group of them said, “O people of Yathrib!1 There is no point in you staying ˹here˺, so retreat!” Another group of them asked the Prophet’s permission ˹to leave˺, saying, “Our homes are vulnerable,” while ˹in fact˺ they were not vulnerable. They only wished to flee. Had their city been sacked from all sides and they had been asked to abandon faith, they would have done so with little hesitation. They had already pledged to Allah earlier never to turn their backs ˹in retreat˺. And a pledge to Allah must be answered for.</li>
          <li>Quran 37-88, ..., 101:  He later looked up to the stars ˹in contemplation˺,1 then said, “I am really sick.”1 So they turned their backs on him and went away.  Then he ˹stealthily˺ advanced towards their gods, and said ˹mockingly˺, “Will you not eat ˹your offerings˺? What is wrong with you that you cannot speak?”  Then he swiftly turned on them, striking ˹them˺ with his right hand. Later, his people came rushing towards him ˹furiously˺. He argued, “How can you worship what you carve ˹with your own hands˺, when it is Allah Who created you and whatever you do?” They said ˹to one another˺, “Build him a furnace and cast him into the blazing fire.” And so they sought to harm him, but We made them inferior. He later said, “I am leaving ˹in obedience˺ to my Lord. He will guide me. My Lord! Bless me with righteous offspring.” So We gave him good news of a forbearing son. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-28: A believing man from Pharaoh’s people, who was hiding his faith, argued, “Will you kill a man1 ˹only˺ for saying: ‘My Lord is Allah,’ while he has in fact come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? If he is a liar, it will be to his own loss. But if he is truthful, then you will be afflicted with some of what he is threatening you with. Surely Allah does not guide whoever is a transgressor, a total liar. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-38: And the man who believed urged, “O my people! Follow me, ˹and˺ I will lead you to the Way of Guidance.</li>
          <li>Quran 43-26, 27: ˹Remember, O  Prophet˺ when Abraham declared to his father and his people, “I am totally free of whatever ˹gods˺ you worship,  except the One Who originated me, and He will surely guide me.” </li>
          <li>Quran 44-19: And do not be arrogant with Allah. I have certainly come to you with a compelling proof. And indeed, </li>
          <li>Quran 47-35: So do not falter or cry for peace, for you will have the upper hand and Allah is with you. And He will never let your deeds go to waste. </li>
          <li>Quran 72-13: When we heard the guidance ˹of the Quran˺, we ˹readily˺ believed in it. For whoever believes in their Lord will have no fear of being denied ˹a reward˺ or wronged. </li>

          <li>Quran 2-109: Many among the People of the Book wish they could turn you ˹believers˺ back to disbelief because of their envy, after the truth has been made clear to them. Pardon and bear with them until Allah delivers His decision. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-153: O believers! Seek comfort in patience and prayer. Allah is truly with those who are patient</li>
          <li>Quran 6-34: Indeed, messengers before you were rejected but patiently endured rejection and persecution until Our help came to them. And Allah’s promise ˹to help˺ is never broken. And you have already received some of the narratives of these messengers. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-115: And be patient! Certainly Allah does not discount the reward of the good-doers. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-90: They replied ˹in shock˺, “Are you really Joseph?” He said, “I am Joseph, and here is my brother ˹Benjamin˺! Allah has truly been gracious to us. Surely whoever is mindful ˹of Allah˺ and patient, then certainly Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-127: Be patient ˹O Prophet˺, for your patience is only with Allah’s help. Do not grieve over those ˹who disbelieve˺, nor be distressed by their schemes. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-58: Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them ˹immediately˺ for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened their punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will find no refuge. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-24: We allow them enjoyment for a little while, then ˹in time˺ We will force them into a harsh torment. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-55: So be patient ˹O Prophet˺, ˹for˺ Allah’s promise is certainly true. Seek forgiveness for your shortcomings.1 And glorify the praises of your Lord morning and evening. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-77: So be patient ˹O Prophet˺. Surely Allah’s promise is true. Whether We show you some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, to Us they will ˹all˺ be returned. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-43: And whoever endures patiently and forgives—surely this is a resolve to aspire to. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-35: So endure patiently, as did the Messengers of Firm Resolve.1 And do not ˹seek to˺ hasten ˹the torment˺ for the deniers. On the Day they see what they have been threatened with, it will be as if they had only stayed ˹in this world˺ for an hour of a day.2 ˹This is˺ a ˹sufficient˺ warning! Then, will anyone be destroyed except the rebellious people? </li>
          <li>Quran 49-5: Had they been patient until you could come out to them, it would have certainly been better for them. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 65-1: O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ When you ˹intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period,1 and count it accurately. And fear Allah, your Lord. Do not force them out of their homes, nor should they leave—unless they commit a blatant misconduct. These are the limits set by Allah. And whoever transgresses Allah’s limits has truly wronged his own soul. You never know, perhaps Allah will bring about a change ˹of heart˺ later.2  </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Five hundred bhikkhus, after accompanying the Buddha to a village, returned to the Jetavana
            monastery. In the evening, while the bhikkhus were talking about the trip, especially the condition of the
            land, whether it was level or hilly, or whether the soil was clayey or sandy, red or black, etc., the
            Buddha
            came to them. Knowing the subject of their talk, he said to them, "Bhikkhus, the earth you are talking
            about
            is external to the body; it is better, indeed, to examine your own body and make preparations (for
            meditation practice)."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 54: The scent of flowers cannot go against the wind; nor the scent of sandalwood, nor
            of
            rhododendron (tagara), nor of jasmin (mallika)2; only the reputation of good people can go against the
            wind.
            The reputation of the virtuous ones (sappurisa) is wafted abroad in all directions.
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada
            Verse 55: There are the scents of sandalwood, rhododendron, lotus and jasmin (vassika)3; but the scent of
            virtue surpasses all scents.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 56: The scents of rhododendron and of sandal wood are very faint; but the scent
            (reputation) of the virtuous is the strongest; it spreads even to the abodes of the deva.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 142: Though he is gaily decked, if he is calm, free from moral defilements, and has his
            senses controlled, if he is established in Magga Insight, if he is pure and has laid aside enmity (lit.,
            weapons) towards all beings, he indeed is a brahmana, a samana, and a bhikkhu. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 165: By oneself indeed is evil done and by oneself is one defiled; by oneself is evil not
            done and by oneself is one purified. Purity and impurity depend entirely on oneself; no one can purify
            another. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 303: He who is full of faith and virtue, who also possesses fame and fortune, is held in
            reverence wherever he goes. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 395: Him I call a brahmana who wears robes made from rags (picked up from a dust heap),
            who is lean with veins standing out, who meditates alone in the forest.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 422: Him I call a brahmana, who is fearless like a bull, who is noble and diligent, who
            is a seeker of high moral virtues and a conqueror (of three Maras), who is free from craving, who has been
            cleansed of moral defilements and knows the Four Noble Truths.</li>

            He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his
            dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his
            speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified: such a person may be said
            indeed to love to learn (C.A. quote 22) </li>

            Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "He acts before he speaks, and
            afterwards speaks according to his actions" (C.A. quote 50)</li>
          <li>The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery?
            But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit
            of
            drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze (C.A. quote 74)</li>
          <li>It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man is selected a
            residence
            do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise? (C.A. quote 102)</li>
          <li>Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a
            condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue (C.A. quote 103)</li>
          <li>It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others (C.A. quote 104)</li>
          <li>If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness (C.A. quote 105)</li>
          <li>If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name? (C.A. quote 107)
          </li>
          <li>The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of
            haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it (C.A. quote 108)</li>
          <li>I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue,
            would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that
            he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person (C.A. quote 109)</li>
          <li>Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors (C.A. quote 131)</li>
          <li>The man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first business, and success only a subsequent
            consideration;-this may be called perfect virtue (C.A. quote 199)</li>
          <li>The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills. The wise are active; the virtuous
            are tranquil. The wise are joyful; the virtuous are long-lived (C.A. 200)</li>
          <li>Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others;
            wishing
            to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others (C.A. quote 208)</li>
          <li>To be able to judge others by what is nigh in ourselves;-this may be called the art of virtue (C.A.
            quote
            209)</li>
          <li>Is virtue a thing remote? I wish to be virtuous, and lo! virtue is at hand (C.A. quote 249)</li>
          <li>If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a
            man
            be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music? (C.A. quote 68)</li>
          <li>I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty (C.A. quote 320)</li>
          <li>The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in his speech (C.A. quote 459)</li>
          <li>Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every
            one
            as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great
            sacrifice;
            not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the
            country,
            and none in the family." Chung-kung said, "Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it
            my business to practice this lesson." (C.A. quote 457)</li>
          <li>Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in
            the
            management of business, to reverently attentive; in intercourse with others to be strictly sincere. Though
            a
            man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected." (C.A. quote 543)</li>
          <li>The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue (C.A. quote 556)</li>
          <li>A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its other good qualities. (C.A. quote 611)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with
            earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course." (C.A. quote 809)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass
            and
            repass it in the small virtues." (C.A. quote 814)</li>
          <li>Yu[-I] those who know virtue are few (C.A. quote 638)</li>
          <li>The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it
            may be known that he is virtuous (C.A. quote 112)</li>
          <li>Virtue is more to man than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on water or fire, but
            I
            have never seen a man die from treading the course of virtue (C.A. quote 679)</li>

          <li>Quran 3-193: Our Lord! We have heard the caller1 to ˹true˺ belief, ˹proclaiming,˺ ‘Believe in your Lord ˹alone˺,’ so we believed. Our Lord! Forgive our sins, absolve us of our misdeeds, and allow us ˹each˺ to die as one of the virtuous. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-198: But those who are mindful of their Lord will be in Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever—as an accommodation from Allah. And what is with Allah is best for the virtuous. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-32: That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity.1 ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-93: There is no blame on those who believe and do good for what they had consumed before ˹the prohibition˺, as long as they fear Allah, have faith, and do what is good; then they believe and act virtuously, then become fully mindful ˹of Allah˺ and do righteous deeds. For Allah loves the good-doers. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-34: And why should Allah not punish them while they hinder pilgrims from the Sacred Mosque, claiming to be its rightful guardians? None has the right to guardianship except those mindful ˹of Allah˺, but most pagans do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-106: No one fabricates lies except those who disbelieve in Allah’s revelations, and it is they who are the ˹true˺ liars. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-18: Do you not see that to Allah bow down ˹in submission˺1 all those in the heavens and all those on the earth, as well as the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and ˹all˺ living beings, as well as many humans, while many are deserving of punishment. And whoever Allah disgraces, none can honour. Surely Allah does what He wills. </li>
          <li>Quran 60-10: O believers! When the believing women come to you as emigrants,1 test their intentions—their faith is best known to Allah—and if you find them to be believers, then do not send them back to the disbelievers. These ˹women˺ are not lawful ˹wives˺ for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful ˹husbands˺ for them. ˹But˺ repay the disbelievers whatever ˹dowries˺ they had paid. And there is no blame on you if you marry these ˹women˺ as long as you pay them their dowries. And do not hold on to marriage with polytheistic women.2 ˹But˺ demand ˹repayment of˺ whatever ˹dowries˺ you had paid, and let the disbelievers do the same. That is the judgment of Allah—He judges between you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 259: He is not "one versed in the Dhamma (Dhammadhara)" just because he talks much. He

          <li>Quran 19-47: Abraham responded, “Peace be upon you! I will pray to my Lord for your forgiveness. He has truly been Most Gracious to me. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-20, 21: ˹One day˺ he inspected the birds, and wondered, “Why is it that I cannot see the hoopoe? Or could he be absent?  I will surely subject him to a severe punishment, or ˹even˺ slaughter him, unless he brings me a compelling excuse.” </li>
          <li>Quran 29-36: And to the people of Midian ˹We sent˺ their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah, and hope for ˹the reward of˺ the Last Day. And do not go about spreading corruption in the land.” </li>
          <li>Quran 30-30: So be steadfast in faith in all uprightness ˹O Prophet˺—the natural Way of Allah which He has instilled in ˹all˺ people. Let there be no change in this creation of Allah. That is the Straight Way, but most people do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-23: the believers are men who have proven true to what they pledged to Allah.1 Some of them have fulfilled their pledge ˹with their lives˺, others are waiting ˹their turn˺. They have never changed ˹their commitment˺ in the least.</li>
          <li>Quran 46-13: Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast—there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 264: Not by a shaven head does a man become a samana, if he lacks morality and austere
            practices and tells lies. How could he who is full of covetousness and greed be a samana?
            Verse 265: He who has totally subdued all evil, great and small, is called a samana because he has overcome
            all evil./li>
          <li>The Story of a Bhikkhu Who Associated With a Follower of Devadatta: To him the Buddha said, "My son, even
            though you have not embraced the doctrine of Devadatta, you are going about as if you were one of his
            followers. A bhikkhu should be contented with what he gets and should not covet other people's gains. A
            bhikkhu who is filled with envy at the good fortune of others will not attain concentration (samadhi), or
            Insight, or the Path that leads to Nibbana (Magga). Only the bhikkhu who is contented with whatever he gets
            will be able to attain concentration, Insight and the Path."</li>

            Quran 2-217: They1 ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about fighting in the sacred months.2 Say, “Fighting during these months is a great sin. But hindering ˹others˺ from the Path of Allah, rejecting Him, and expelling the worshippers from the Sacred Mosque is ˹a˺ greater ˹sin˺ in the sight of Allah. For persecution3 is far worse than killing. And they will not stop fighting you until they turn you away from your faith—if they can. And whoever among you renounces their own faith and dies a disbeliever, their deeds will become void in this life and in the Hereafter. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.”4

      <h4>The prophets on self-restraint</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 6: People, other than the wise, do not realize, "We in this world must all die," (and,
            not realizing it, continue their quarrels). The wise realize it and thereby their quarrels cease.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada The Story of a Farmer: "A wise man should not do anything that he would repent after doing
            it."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 68: That deed is well done if one has not to repent for having done it, and if one is
            delightful and happy with the result of that deed. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 134: If you can keep yourself calm and quiet like a broken gong which is no longer
            resonant, you are sure to realize Nibbana, there will be no harshness in you.</li>
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 143: Rare in this world is the kind of person who out of a sense of shame restrains from
            doing evil and keeps himself awake like a good horse that gives no cause to be whipped.
            Verse 144: Like a good horse stirred at a touch of the whip, be diligent and get alarmed by endless round of
            rebirths (i.e., samsara). By faith, morality, effort, concentration, discernment of the Dhamma, be endowed
            with knowledge and practice of morality, and with mindfulness, leave this immeasurable dukkha (of samsara)
            behind.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 183: Not to do evil, to cultivate merit, to purify one's mind - this is the Teaching of
            the Buddhas.
            Verse 184: The best moral practice is patience and forbearance; "Nibbana is Supreme", said the Buddhas. A
            bhikkhu does not harm others; one who harms others is not a bhikkhu.
            Verse 185: Not to revile, not to do any harm, to practise restraint according to the Fundamental
            Instructions for the bhikkhus, to be moderate in taking food, to dwell in a secluded place, to devote
            oneself to higher concentration - this is the Teaching of the Buddhas.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Bhikkhu: To her the Buddha said, "O rukkha devata! You have done well to control yourself."
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 222: He who restrains his rising anger as a skilful charioteer checks a speeding chariot,
            — him I call a true charioteer; other charioteers only hold the reins. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 360: Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear; restraint in the nose is
            good, good is restraint in the tongue.
            Verse 361: Restraint in body is good, good is restraint in speech; restraint in mind is good, good is
            restraint in all the senses. A bhikkhu restrained in all the senses is freed from all ills (Samsara dukkha).
          </li>
          <li>The Story of Bhikkhu Kokalika: To those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! A bhikkhu must have control
            over his tongue; his conduct must be good; his mind must be calm, subdued and not flitting about as it
            pleases."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 375: For a wise bhikkhu in this Teaching, this is the beginning (of the practice leading
            to Nibbana): control of the senses, contentment, and restraint according to the Fundamental Precepts.
          <li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 390: For a brahmana there is no benefit at all if he does not restrain from anger to
            which his mind is prone. Inasmuch as one desists from the intention to harm, to that extent dukkha ceases.

          <li>There are three principles of conduct which the man of high rank should consider specially important:

            keep near to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and impropriety. As to
            matters as attending to the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them (C.A. quote 266)

          <li>Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated. (C.A. quote 640)
            The Master said, "Let his words be sincere and truthful and his actions honorable and careful;-such
            conduct
            may be practiced among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If his words be not sincere and truthful
            and his actions not honorable and careful will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his
            neighborhood? (C.A. quote 641) "When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, fronting
            him.
            When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them into

          <li>The Story of Santati the Minister: "In the past there has been in you clinging (upadana) due to craving;
            get rid of it. In future, do not let such clinging occur in you. Do not also harbour any clinging in the
            present; by not having any clinging, craving and passion will be calmed in you and you will realize
            Nibbana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 285: Cut off your craving as one plucks an autumn lily with the hand. Nibbana has been
            expounded on by the Buddha; cultivate that Path which leads to it. </li>
          <li>On Subduing Oneself: Hearing those abusive words, the Venerable Ananda pleaded with the Buddha to leave
            the town and go to another place. But the Buddha refused and said, "In another town also we might be abused
            and it is not feasible to move out every time one is abused. It is better to solve a problem in the place
            where it arises. I am like an elephant in a battlefield; like an elephant who withstands the arrows that
            come from all quarters, I also will bear patiently the abuses that come from people without morality.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 349: In a man who is disturbed by (sensual) thoughts, whose passions are strong, and who
            keeps seeing objects as being pleasant, craving grows more and more. Indeed, he makes his bondage strong.

          <li>Dhammapada Verses 104 & 105: It is better indeed, to conquer oneself than to conquer others. Neither a
            deva, nor a gandhabba, nor Mara together with Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of the man who
            controls himself. </li>
          <li>The Story of Anathapindika: When the guardian spirit told Anathapindika about the information and
            instructions given by Sakka, about the recovery of his riches from underneath the earth, from within the
            ocean and from the debtors, he was struck with awe. Then Anathapindika took the guardian spirit to the
            Buddha. To both of them the Buddha said, "One may not enjoy the benefits of a good deed, or suffer the
            consequences of a bad deed for a long time; but time will surely come when his good or bad deed will bear
            fruit and ripen".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 308: It is better for one to eat a red-hot lump of iron burning like a flame than to eat
            alms-food offered by the people, if one is without morality (sila) and unrestrained in thought, word and
            deed.</li>

            Confucius said, "Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The

          <li>Quran 60-1: O believers! Do not take My enemies and yours as trusted allies, showing them affection even though they deny what has come to you of the truth. They drove the Messenger and yourselves out ˹of Mecca˺, simply for your belief in Allah, your Lord. If you ˹truly˺ emigrated1 to struggle in My cause and seek My pleasure, ˹then do not take them as allies,˺ disclosing secrets ˹of the believers˺ to the pagans out of affection for them, when I know best whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal.

            superior to other people. So the Buddha said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus! Thera Vaccha addresses others as
            'wretch' only by force of habit acquired in the course of his five hundred existences as a brahmin, and not

          <li>Genesis 50-16, ..., 21: And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</li>
          <li>Exodus 2-6, ..., 10: Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</li>
          <li>Exodus 8-21, ..., 24: Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.</li>
          <li>Exodus 23-9: Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</li>

            Quran 1-3: the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-220: upon this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you ˹O Prophet˺ concerning orphans. Say, “Improving their condition is best. And if you partner with them, they are bonded with you ˹in faith˺.1 And Allah knows who intends harm and who intends good. Had Allah willed, He could have made it difficult for you.2 Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-94: O believers! When you struggle in the cause of Allah, be sure of who you fight. And do not say to those who offer you ˹greetings of˺ peace, “You are no believer!”—seeking a fleeting worldly gain.1 Instead, Allah has infinite bounties ˹in store˺. You were initially like them then Allah blessed you ˹with Islam˺. So be sure! Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-70: O Prophet! Tell the captives in your custody, “If Allah finds goodness in your hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and forgive you. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-102: Some others have confessed their wrongdoing: they have mixed goodness with evil.1 It is right to hope that Allah will turn to them in mercy. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-25: And Allah invites ˹all˺ to the Home of Peace and guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-82: But I am truly Most Forgiving to whoever repents, believes, and does good, then persists on ˹true˺ guidance.” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-16: We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between for sport. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-68: But if they argue with you, then say, “Allah knows best what you do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 24-58: O believers! Let those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession and those of you who are still under age ask for your permission ˹to come in˺ at three times: before dawn prayer, when you take off your ˹outer˺ clothes at noon, and after the late evening prayer. ˹These are˺ three times of privacy for you. Other than these times, there is no blame on you or them to move freely, attending to one another. This is how Allah makes the revelations clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-58: We have certainly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people in this Quran. And no matter what sign you bring to them ˹O Prophet˺, the disbelievers will definitely say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only a people of falsehood.” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-10: And protect them from ˹the consequences of their˺ evil deeds. For whoever You protect from the evil of their deeds on that Day will have been shown Your mercy. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.” </li>
          <li>Quran 45-14: ˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the believers to forgive those who do not fear Allah’s days ˹of torment˺, so that He will reward each group for what they used to commit. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-27: We certainly destroyed the societies around you after having varied the signs so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 57-25: Indeed, We sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and with them We sent down the Scripture and the balance ˹of justice˺ so that people may administer justice. And We sent down iron with its great might, benefits for humanity, and means for Allah to prove who ˹is willing to˺ stand up for Him and His messengers without seeing Him. Surely Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty. </li>
          <li>Quran 64-14: O believers! Indeed, some of your spouses and children are enemies to you,1 so beware of them. But if you pardon, overlook, and forgive ˹their faults˺, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>

      <h4>The prophets on knowledge</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 38: If a man's mind is unsteady, if he is ignorant of the true Dhamma, and if his faith
            is wavering, then his knowledge will never be perfect.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 57: Mara cannot find the path taken by those who are endowed with virtue, who live
            mindfully and have been freed from moral defilements by Right Knowledge.1</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 58 - 59: As a sweet-smelling and beautiful lotus flower may grow upon a heap of
            rubbish thrown on the highway, so also, out of the rubbish heap of beings may appear a disciple of the
            Buddha, who with his wisdom shines forth far above the blind (ignorant) worldlings.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 113: Better than a hundred years in the life of a person who does not perceive the
            arising and the dissolving of the five aggregates (khandhas), is a day in the life of one who perceives the
            arising and dissolving of the five aggregates.</li>
          <li>The Story of Mahadhana: "Bhikkhus, Mahadhana keeps away from the journey beset with bandits; one who does
            not want to die keeps away from poison; so also, a wise bhikkhu, realizing that the three levels of
            existence* are like a journey beset with, danger, should strive to keep away from doing evil."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 87 & 88: The man of wisdom, leaving the home of craving and having Nibbana as his goal,
            should give up dark, evil ways and cultivate pure, good ones. He should seek great delight in solitude,
            detachment and Nibbana, which an ordinary man finds so difficult to enjoy. He should also give up sensual
            pleasures, and clinging to nothing, should cleanse himself of all impurities of the mind.
            Verse 89: Those, with mind well-developed in the seven Factors of Enlightenment (bojjhanga), having rid
            themselves of all craving, rejoice in their abandonment of attachment. Such men, with all moral
            intoxicants eradicated, and powerful (with the light of Arahatta Magganana), have realized Nibbana in this
            world (i.e., with Khandha aggregates remaining).</li>
          <li>The Story of Kala, son of Anathapindika: Then, his father brought one thousand, and told Kala to take the
            money but surprisingly he refused. His father pressed him to take it, but he still refused. Then,
            Anathapindika said to the Buddha, "Venerable Sir, my son is quite changed; he now behaves in a very pleasant
            manner." Then he related to the Buddha how he had enticed the youth with money to go to the monastery and
            keep sabbath and to learn some religious texts. To him the Buddha replied, "Anathapindika! Today, your son
            has attained Sotapatti Fruition, which is much better than the riches of the Universal Monarch or that of
            the devas or that of the brahmas."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 178: Far better than sovereignty over the earth, or far better than going to the abodes
            of the devas, or far better than ruling supreme over the entire universe, is (the attainment of) Sotapatti
            Fruition. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 186 & 187: Not by a shower of coins can sensual desires be satiated; sensual desires
            give little pleasure and are fraught with evil consequences (dukkha). Knowing this, the wise man, who is the
            disciple of the Buddha, does not find delight even in the pleasures of the devas, but rejoices in the
            cessation of craving (i.e., Nibbana). </li>
          <li>The Story of Many Bhikkhus: Once, five hundred bhikkhus were discussing the question "What constitutes
            happiness?" These bhikkhus realized that happiness meant different things to different people. Thus, they
            said, "To some people to have the riches and glory like that of a king's is happiness, to some people
            sensual pleasure is happiness, but to others to have good rice cooked with meat is happiness." While they
            were talking, the Buddha came in. After learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, all
            the pleasures you have mentioned do not get you out of the round of rebirths. In this world, these
            constitute happiness: the arising of a Buddha, the opportunity to hear the Teaching of the Sublime Truth,
            and the harmony amongst the bhikkhus,</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 194: Happy is the arising of a Buddha; happy is the exposition of the Ariya Dhamma; happy
            is the harmony amongst the Samgha; happy is the practice of those in harmony.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 202: There is no fire like passion; there is no evil like hatred; there is no ill like
            (the burden of) khandhas; there is no bliss that surpasses the Perfect Peace (i.e., Nibbana). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 203: Hunger is the greatest ailment, khandhas are the greatest ill. The wise, knowing
            them as they really are, realize Nibbana, the greatest bliss. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 204: Health is the greatest gift, contentment is the greatest wealth, a trusted friend is
            the best relative, Nibbana is the greatest bliss. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 213: Endearment begets sorrow, endearment begets fear. For him who is free from
            endearment there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 214: Attachment (to sensual pleasures) begets sorrow, attachment begets fear. For him who
            is free from attachment there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 215: Lust begets sorrow, lust begets fear. For him who is free from lust there is no
            sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 216: Craving begets sorrow, craving begets fear. For him who is free from craving there
            is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 218: He who has developed a desire for the Ineffable (i.e., Nibbana), whose mind reaches
            the same, and is no longer attached to the sensual world (kamaloka), is called one who is bound upstream
            (uddhamsoto). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 221: Give up anger, abandon conceit, overcome all fetters. Ills of life (dukkha) do not
            befall [on] one who does not cling to mind and body and is free from moral defilements. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 223: Conquer the angry one by not getting angry (i.e., by loving-kindness); conquer the
            wicked by goodness; conquer the stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 224: One should speak the truth, one should not yield to anger, one should give when
            asked even if it is only a little. By means of these three, one may go to the world of the devas. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 225: The arahats, who do not harm others and are always restrained in their actions, go
            to the deathless Nibbana, where there is no sorrow. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 226: In those who are ever vigilant, who by day and by night train themselves in the
            three sikkhas (i.e., sila, samadhi and panna), and who have their mind directed towards Nibbana, moral
            intoxicants become extinct. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 251: There is no fire like passion, there is no grip like ill will, there is no net like
            ignorance, there is no river like craving. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Ujjhanasanni: The Buddha replied to them, "Bhikkhus, if someone finds fault with
            another so as to teach him in good way; it is not an act of evil and is therefore not to be blamed. But, if
            someone is always finding fault with others and speaking ill of them just out of spite and malice, he will
            not attain concentration and mental absorption (jhana). He will not be able to understand the Dhamma, and
            moral (intoxicants asavas) will increase in him."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 254: In the sky there is no track; outside the Buddha's Teaching there is no ariya
            bhikkhu (samana). All beings take delight in fetters (i.e., craving, pride and wrong view) that prolong
            samsara; all the Buddhas are free from these fetters.
            Verse 255: In the sky there is no track; outside the Buddha's Teaching there is no ariya bhikkhu (samana).
            There is no conditioned thing that is permanent; all the Buddhas are unperturbed (by craving, pride and
            wrong view).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 258: He is not a wise man just because he talks much; only he who is peaceful, free from
            enmity, and does no harm to others, is to be called 'a wise man'.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 270: He who harms living beings is, for that reason, not an ariya (a Noble One); he who
            does not harm any living being is called an ariya1.
            1. ariya: one who has realized one of the four maggas.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 273: Of paths, the Path of Eight Constituents is the noblest; of truths, the Four Noble
            Truths are the noblest; of the dhammas, the absence of craving (i.e., Nibbana) is the noblest; of the
            two-legged beings, the All-Seeing Buddha is the noblest.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 277: "All conditioned phenomena are impermanent"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom,
            one becomes weary of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.
            Verse 278: "All conditioned phenomena are dukkha"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom, one becomes weary
            of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.
            Verse 279: "All phenomena (dhammas) are without Self"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom, one becomes
            weary of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.</li>
          <li>The Story of Patacara*: When she approached the Buddha, he said to her, "Patacara, sons and daughters
            cannot look after you; so even if they are alive they do not exist for you. The wise man observes morality
            (sila) and clears (the obstacles to) the Path leading to Nibbana."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Wood-Cutter's Son: The king asked the Buddha, "Is mindfulness of the unique qualities of
            the Buddha, the only dhamma that gives one protection against evil and danger, or is mindfulness of the
            unique qualities of the Dhamma equally potent and powerful?" To him the Buddha replied, "O king, my
            disciple! There are six things, mindfulness of which is a good protection against evil and danger."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 302: It is hard to become a bhikkhu; it is hard to be happy in the practice of a bhikkhu.
            The hard life of a householder is painful; to live with those of a different temperament is painful. A
            traveller in samsara is continually subject to dukkha; therefore, do not be a traveller in samsara; do not
            be the one to be subject to dukkha again and again. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 348: Give up the past, give up the future, give up the present. Having reached the end of
            existences, with a mind freed from all (conditioned things), you will not again undergo birth and decay.
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 373: The bhikkhu who goes into seclusion (to meditate), whose mind is tranquil, who
            clearly perceives the Dhamma, experiences the joy which transcends that of (ordinary) men.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 381: The bhikkhu who frequently feels joy and is devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha
            will realize Nibbana — the Tranquil, the Unconditioned, the Blissful.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 403: Him I call a brahmana, who is wise and is profound in his knowledge, who knows the
            right way from the wrong way, and who has attained the highest goal (i.e., arahatship).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 419: Him I call a brahmana, who knows the death and rebirth of beings in every detail,
            who is detached, who follows the good practice and knows the Four Noble Truths.
            Verse 420: Him I call a brahmana, whose destination the devas or gandhabbas or men do not know who has
            eradicated moral intoxicants and is an arahat.</li>

          <li>Quran 19-48: As I distance myself from ˹all of˺ you and from whatever you invoke besides Allah, I will ˹continue to˺ call upon my Lord ˹alone˺, trusting that I will never be disappointed in invoking my Lord.” </li>
          <li>Quran 26-61, 62: When the two groups came face to face, the companions of Moses cried out, “We are overtaken for sure.” Moses reassured ˹them˺, “Absolutely not! My Lord is certainly with me—He will guide me.” </li>
          <li>Quran 39-39, 40: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I ˹too˺ will persist in mine. You will soon come to know who will be visited by a humiliating torment ˹in this life˺ and overwhelmed by an everlasting punishment ˹in the next˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 52-30, 31: Or do they say, “˹He is˺ a poet, for whom we ˹eagerly˺ await an ill-fate!”? Say, “Keep waiting! I too am waiting with you.” </li>
          <li>Quran 56-75, ..., 80: So I do swear by the positions of the stars— and this, if only you knew, is indeed a great oath— that this is truly a noble Quran, in a well-preserved Record,1 touched by none except the purified ˹angels˺.1 ˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds. </li>
          <li>Quran 67-22: Who is ˹rightly˺ guided: the one who crawls facedown or the one who walks upright on the Straight Path? </li>
          <li>Quran 81-15, ..., 29: I do swear by the receding stars which travel and hide,1 and the night as it falls and the day as it breaks!1  Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the Word of ˹Allah delivered by Gabriel,˺ a noble messenger-angel,  full of power, held in honour by the Lord of the Throne, obeyed there ˹in heaven˺, and trustworthy.  And your fellow man1 is not insane. And he did see that ˹angel˺ on the clear horizon,1  and he does not withhold ˹what is revealed to him of˺ the unseen. And this ˹Quran˺ is not the word of an outcast devil.1 So what ˹other˺ path would you take? Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole world— to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Way. But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds. </li>
          <li>Quran 84-16, 18, 19: So, I do swear by the twilight! And by the night and whatever it envelops! And by the moon when it waxes full! You will certainly pass from one state to another.1 </li>

      <h4>The prophets on being well-rounded</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>The Story of Adhimanika Bhikkhus: There, when they saw the putrid corpses they could look at them as just
            skeletons, and bones, but when they saw some fresh dead bodies they realized, with horror, that they still
            had some sensual desires awakening in them. The Buddha saw them from his perfumed chamber and sent forth the
            radiance; then he appeared to them and said, "Bhikkhus! Seeing these bleached bones, is it proper for you to
            have any sensual desire in you?"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 157: If one knows that one is dear to oneself, one should protect oneself well. During
            any of the three watches (of life) the wise man should be on guard (against evil).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 166: For the sake of another's benefit, however great it may be, do not neglect one's own
            (moral) benefit. Clearly perceiving one's own benefit one should make every effort to attain it. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 170: If a man looks at the world (i.e., the five khandhas) in the same way as one looks
            at a bubble or a mirage, the King of Death will not find him. </li>
          <li>The Story of Visakha: So she went to the Buddha; when the Buddha saw her, he said, "Visakha, don't you
            realize that many people die in Savatthi every day? If you were to regard all of them as you regard your own
            grandchild you would have to be endlessly weeping and mourning. Let not the death of a child affect you too
            much. Sorrow and fear arise out of endearment."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 231: Guard against evil deeds, control your body. Giving up evil deeds, cultivate good
            deeds.
            Verse 232: Guard against evil speech, control your speech. Giving up evil speech, cultivate good speech.
            Verse 233: Guard against evil thoughts, control your mind. Giving up evil thoughts, cultivate good thoughts.
            Verse 234: The wise are controlled in deed, they are controlled in speech, they are controlled in thought.
            Indeed, they are perfectly self-controlled.</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Bhikkhus: Finally, they went to the Buddha to ask for his decision. The Buddha said to
            them, "Each of the senses is just as difficult to control as the other; but all bhikkhus must control all
            the five senses and not just one. Only those who control all the senses would escape from the round of
            rebirths."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 374: Every time he clearly comprehends the arising and the perishing of the khandhas, he
            finds joy and rapture. That, to the wise, is the way to Nibbana (the Deathless).</li>
          <li>The Story of a Brahmin Recluse: So he went to the Buddha and posed the question why he should not be
            called a pabbajita. The Buddha's answer to him was this: "Just because one is a recluse one does not
            automatically become a pabbajita; a pabbajita must have other qualifications also."</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "The officer, having discharged all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning.
            The
            student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an officer." (C.A. quote 817)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "Mourning, having been carried to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that."
            (C.A. quote 818)</li>
          <li>With sincere faith he unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is perfecting the exellence
            of is course (C.A. quote 278)</li>
          <li>I would not have him to act with me, who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a boat,
            dying without any regret. My associate must be the man who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is
            fond of adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution (C.A. 225)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu asked what constituted a COMPLETE man. The Master said, "Suppose a man with the knowledge of
            Tsang
            Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of CHwang of Pien, and the varied
            talents
            of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the rules of propriety and music;-such a one might be
            reckoned a COMPLETE man." (C.A. quote 575)</li>
          <li>Where the solid qualities are in excess of accomplishments, we have rusticity [(inelegance)]; where the
            accomplishments
            are in excess of the solid qualities, we have the manners of a clerk. When the accomplishments and solid
            qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue (C.A. quote 195)</li>
          <li>The Master was mild, and yet dignified; majestic, and yet not fierce; respectful, and yet easy (C.A.
            quote
            259)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Exodus 10-1, 2: And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.</li>
          <li>Exodus 13-9: And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.</li>

          <li>Quran 6-133: Your Lord is the Self-Sufficient, Full of Mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you and replace you with whoever He wills, just as He produced you from the offspring of other people. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-33: But Allah would never punish them while you ˹O Prophet˺ were in their midst. Nor would He ever punish them if they prayed for forgiveness. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-44: Then when your armies met, Allah made them appear as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in theirs, so Allah may establish what He had destined. And to Allah ˹all˺ matters will be returned ˹for judgment˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-120: And We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ the stories of the messengers to reassure your heart. And there has come to you in this ˹sûrah˺ the truth, a warning ˹to the disbelievers˺, and a reminder to the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-46: Have they not travelled throughout the land so their hearts may reason, and their ears may listen? Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the chests that grow blind. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-43: Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ the one who has taken their own desires as their god? Will you then be a keeper over them? </li>
          <li>Quran 28-77: Rather, seek the ˹reward˺ of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good ˹to others˺ as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah certainly does not like the corruptors.” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-21: Have they not travelled throughout the land to see what was the end of those ˹destroyed˺ before them? They were far superior in might and ˹richer in˺ monuments throughout the land. But Allah seized them for their sins, and they had no protector from Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-43: ˹O Prophet!˺ Nothing is said to you ˹by the deniers˺ except what was already said to the messengers before you. Surely your Lord is ˹the Lord˺ of forgiveness and painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 53-32: those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, despite ˹stumbling on˺ minor sins. Surely your Lord is infinite in forgiveness. He knew well what would become of you as He created you from the earth1 and while you were ˹still˺ fetuses in the wombs of your mothers.2 So do not ˹falsely˺ elevate yourselves. He knows best who is ˹truly˺ righteous. </li>
          <li>Quran 57-3: He is the First and the Last, the Most High and Most Near,1 and He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. </li>
          <li>Quran 57-23: ˹We let you know this˺ so that you neither grieve over what you have missed nor boast over what He has granted you. For Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful— </li>
          <li>Quran 102-5:  Indeed, if you were to know ˹your fate˺ with certainty, ˹you would have acted differently˺. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 53: As from a collection of flowers many a garland can be made by an expert florist, so
            also, much good can be done (with wealth, out of faith and generosity) by one subject to birth and death.
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 97: He who is not credulous, who has realized the Unconditioned (Nibbana), who has cut
            off the links of the round of rebirths, who has destroyed all consequences of good and bad deeds, who has
            discarded all craving, is indeed the noblest of all men (i.e., an arahat). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 102: Better than the recitation of a hundred verses that are senseless and unconnected
            with the realization of Nibbana, is the recitation of a single verse of the Teaching (Dhamma), if on hearing
            it one is calmed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 123: Just as a wealthy merchant with few attendants avoids a dangerous road, just as one
            who desires to go on living avoids poison, so also, one should avoid evil. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: Having heard his explanation, the Buddha said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus! Those
            who love and respect me should act like Tissa. You are not paying homage to me by just offering me flowers,
            perfumes and incense. You pay homage to me only by practising the Lokuttara Dhamma, i.e., Insight
            Meditation."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 326: In the past, this mind has wandered as it liked, wherever it liked, at its own
            pleasure. Now I will control my mind wisely, as a mahout with his goad controls an elephant in must. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Abusive Brahmin Brothers: The Buddha in his turn asked, "O brahmin, let us suppose you
            offered some food to some guests and they left the house without taking the food. Since the guests did not
            accept your food, to whom would that food belong?" To this question the brahmin answered that the food would
            be his. On receiving that answer, the Buddha said, "In the same way, O brahmin, since I do not accept your
            abuse, the abuse would only go back to you."</li>

          <li>When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities

          <li>The Master said, "Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home to serve one's father and
            elder
            brothers in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's self; and not to be overcome of
            wine:-which one of the things do I attain to?" (C.A. quote 318) The Master standing by a stream said, "It
            passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!" (C.A. quote 319)</li>

And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.</li>

And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.</li>
          <li>Exodus 16-31, ..., 34: And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

He knows best what ˹slurs˺ you indulge about it. Sufficient is He as a Witness between you and me. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 47-30: Had We willed, We could have truly shown them to you ˹O Prophet˺, and you would have certainly recognized them by their appearance. But you will surely recognize them by their tone of speech. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows your doings ˹O people˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 49-6: O believers, if an evildoer brings you any news, verify ˹it˺ so you do not harm people unknowingly, becoming regretful for what you have done.1</li>
          <li>Quran 52-34: Let them then produce something like it, if what they say is true!1</li>
          <li>Quran 67-16: Do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up as it quakes violently? </li>
          <li>Quran 67-30: Say, “Consider this: if your water were to sink ˹into the earth˺, then who ˹else˺ could bring you flowing water?” </li>
          <li>Quran 73-19: Surely this is a reminder. So let whoever wills take the ˹Right˺ Way to their Lord. </li>
          <li>Quran 76-13, ..., 21: There they will be reclining on ˹canopied˺ couches, never seeing scorching heat or bitter cold.1 The Garden’s shade will be right above them, and its fruit will be made very easy to reach. They will be waited on with silver vessels and cups of crystal— crystalline silver, filled precisely as desired. And they will be given a drink ˹of pure wine˺ flavoured with ginger from a spring there, called Salsabîl. They will be waited on by eternal youths. If you saw them, you would think they were scattered pearls. And if you looked around, you would see ˹indescribable˺ bliss and a vast kingdom. The virtuous will be ˹dressed˺ in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade, and adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a purifying drink.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 88-17, ..., 20: Do they not ever reflect on camels—how they were ˹masterfully˺ created;1 and the sky—how it was raised ˹high˺;  and the mountains—how they were firmly set up; and the earth—how it was levelled out? </li>
          <li>Quran 88-23, ..., 26: But whoever turns away, persisting in disbelief, then Allah will inflict upon them the major punishment.1 Surely to Us is their return, then surely with Us is their reckoning. </li>
          <li>Quran 109-1, ..., 6: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O you disbelievers! I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship. I will never worship what you worship, nor will you ever worship what I worship. You have your way, and I have my Way.” </li>

            Dhammapada Verse 8: He who keeps his mind on the impurities (of the body), who is well-controlled in his
            senses and is full of faith and energy, will certainly be not overwhelmed by Mara, just as stormy winds
            cannot shake a mountain of rock.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 60: Long is the night to one who is wakeful; long is (the journey of) one yojana to the
            traveller who is tired; long is samsara (round of rebirths) to the fool, who is ignorant of the true
            Dhamma (the Teaching of the Buddha).</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera* Sukha: "When a person earnestly practises the Dhamma, even Sakka and the devas give
            protection and help. I myself have kept Sariputta at the entrance so that Sukha should not be disturbed. The
            samanera, having seen the farmers irrigating their fields, the fletchers straightening their arrows and the
            carpenters making cart-wheels and other things, trains his mind and practises the Dhamma. Thus, he has now
            become an arahat."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 235: You are now like a withered leaf; the messengers of death are near you; you are
            about to set out on a long journey; (yet), you have no provisions (for the journey).
            Verse 236: Make a firm support for yourself; hasten to strive hard, and be wise. Having removed impurities
            and being free from moral defilements you shall enter the abodes of the Ariyas (i.e., Suddhavasa brahma
            realm).
            Verse 237: Now you are of advanced age; you are going to the presence of the King of Death and you cannot
            stop on the way; (yet) you have no provisions (for the journey).
            Verse 238: Make a firm support for yourself; hasten to strive hard, and be wise. Having removed impurities
            and being free from moral defilements you will no longer be subject to rebirth and decay.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Nangalakula: Whenever this feeling arose in him, he would go to the tree near the
            monastery, the tree where he had left his plough and his old clothes. There he would reproach himself
            saying, "O you shameless man! Do you still want to put on these old rags and return to the hard, lowly life
            of a hired labourer ?" After this, his dissatisfaction with the life of a bhikkhu would disappear and he
            would go back to the monastery</li>

            Genesis 39-21, 22, 23: But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

          <li>Exodus 2-16, ..., 22: Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</li>
          <li>Exodus 14-10, ..., 18: And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</li>
          <li>Exodus 16-4, ..., 6: Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:</li>
          <li>Exodus 23-22, 23: But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.</li>
          <li>Exodus 23-25: And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.</li>
          <li>Exodus 23-27, 28: I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</li>
          <li>Exodus 29-42, ..., 45: This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.</li>

          <li>Quran 6-92: This is a blessed Book which We have revealed—confirming what came before it—so you may warn the Mother of Cities1 and everyone around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter ˹truly˺ believe in it and guard their prayers. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-156: Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You ˹in repentance˺.” Allah replied, “I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-26: Remember when you had been vastly outnumbered and oppressed in the land,1 constantly in fear of attacks by your enemy, then He sheltered you, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so perhaps you would be thankful.
          <li>Quran 8-65: O Prophet! Motivate the believers to fight. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are one hundred of you, they will overcome one thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a people who do not comprehend. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-71: The believers, both men and women, are guardians of one another. They encourage good and forbid evil, establish prayer and pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is they who will be shown Allah’s mercy. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-89: O  my people! Do not let your opposition to me lead you to a fate similar to that of the people of Noah, or Hûd, or Ṣâliḥ. And the people of Lot are not far from you.1</li>
          <li>Quran 12-18: And they brought his shirt, stained with false blood.1 He responded, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something ˹evil˺. So ˹I can only endure with˺ beautiful patience!2 It is Allah’s help that I seek to bear your claims.” </li>
          <li>Quran 12-33:  Joseph prayed, “My Lord! I would rather be in jail than do what they invite me to. And if You do not turn their cunning away from me, I might yield to them and fall into ignorance.” </li>

          <li>Quran 16-98, 99, 100: When you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed. He certainly has no authority over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord. His authority is only over those who take him as a patron and who—under his influence—associate ˹others˺ with Allah ˹in worship˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-128: Surely Allah is with those who shun evil and who do good ˹deeds˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-123, 124: Allah said, “Descend, both of you, from here together ˹with Satan˺ as enemies to each other. Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray ˹in this life˺ nor suffer ˹in the next˺. But whoever turns away from My Reminder will certainly have a miserable life,1 then We will raise them up blind on the Day of Judgment.” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-83, 84: And ˹remember˺ when Job cried out to his Lord, “I have been touched with adversity,1 and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” So We answered his prayer and removed his adversity, and gave him back his family, twice as many, as a mercy from Us and a lesson for the ˹devoted˺ worshippers. </li>

          <li>Quran 40-45: So Allah protected him from the evil of their schemes. And Pharaoh’s people were overwhelmed by an evil punishment: </li>
          <li>Quran 40-51: We certainly help Our messengers and the believers, ˹both˺ in this worldly life and on the Day the witnesses will stand forth ˹for testimony˺— </li>
          <li>Quran 40-60: Your Lord has proclaimed, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Surely those who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell, fully humbled.” </li>

          <li>Quran 47-11: This is because Allah is the Patron of the believers while the disbelievers have no patron. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-18: Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down serenity upon them and rewarded them with a victory at hand,1 </li>
          <li>Quran 48-26: ˹Remember˺ when the disbelievers had filled their hearts with pride—the pride of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance1—then Allah sent down His serenity upon His Messenger and the believers, inspiring them to uphold the declaration of faith,2 for they were better entitled and more worthy of it. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. </li>
          <li>Quran 52-9, ..., 15: Before them, the people of Noah denied ˹the truth˺ and rejected Our servant, calling ˹him˺ insane. And he was intimidated. So he cried out to his Lord, “I am helpless, so help ˹me˺!” So We opened the gates of the sky with pouring rain, and caused the earth to burst with springs, so the waters met for a fate already set. We carried him on that ˹Ark made˺ of planks and nails, sailing under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes—a ˹fair˺ punishment on behalf of the one ˹they˺ denied. We certainly left this1 as a sign. So is there anyone who will be mindful? </li>
          <li>Quran 61-10: O believers! Shall I guide you to an exchange that will save you from a painful punishment? </li>
          <li>Quran 61-13: ˹He will also give you˺ another favour that you long for: help from Allah and an imminent victory. ˹So˺ give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 61-14: O believers! Stand up for Allah, as Jesus, son of Mary, asked the disciples, “Who will stand up with me for Allah?” The disciples replied, “We will stand up for Allah.” Then a group from the Children of Israel believed while another disbelieved. We then supported the believers against their enemies, so they prevailed. </li>
          <li>Quran 64-11: No calamity befalls ˹anyone˺ except by Allah’s Will. And whoever has faith in Allah, He will ˹rightly˺ guide their hearts ˹through adversity˺. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. </li>
          <li>Quran 87-9: So ˹always˺ remind ˹with the Quran˺—˹even˺ if the reminder is beneficial ˹only to some˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 94-1, ..., 8: Have We not uplifted your heart for you ˹O Prophet˺, relieved you of the burden which weighed so heavily on your back, and elevated your renown for you?1 So, surely with hardship comes ease. Surely with ˹that˺ hardship comes ˹more˺ ease.1 So once you have fulfilled ˹your duty˺, strive ˹in devotion˺, turning to your Lord ˹alone˺ with hope. </li>
          <li>Quran 105-1, ..., 5: Have you not seen ˹O Prophet˺ how your Lord dealt with the Army of the Elephant? Did He not frustrate their scheme? For He sent against them flocks of birds, that pelted them with stones of baked clay, leaving them like chewed up straw.1  </li>    
          <li>Quran 113-1, ..., 5: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak from the evil of whatever He has created, and from the evil of the night when it grows dark, and from the evil of those ˹witches casting spells by˺ blowing onto knots, and from the evil of an envier when they envy.”</li>
          <li>Quran 114-1, ..., 6: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind, the Master of humankind, the God of humankind, from the evil of the lurking whisperer— who whispers into the hearts of humankind— from among jinn and humankind.” </li>

      <h4>The prophets on increasing fortune</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 2: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief;
            they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow
            that
            never leaves him.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 24: If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in his thought, word and deed, and if he
            does
            every thing with care and consideration, restrains his senses, earns his living according to the Law
            (Dhamma) and is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune of that mindful person steadily increase.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 76: One should follow a man of wisdom who rebukes one for one's faults, as one would
            follow a guide to some buried treasure. To one who follows such a wise man, it will be an advantage and
            not a disadvantage. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Brahmin Anatthapucchaka: Further, the Buddha asked the brahmin how he earned his living,
            and the brahmin replied that he earned his living by playing dice, i.e., by gambling. Next, the Buddha asked
            him whether he won or lost. When the brahmin answered that he sometimes lost and sometimes won, the Buddha
            said to him, "To win in a game of dice is nothing compared to a victory over moral defilements."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 109: For one who always respects and honours those who are older and more virtuous, four
            benefits, viz., longevity, beauty, happiness and strength, will increase. </li>
          <li>The Story of Ayuvaddhanakumara: When the child grew up, he went about the country with a company of five
            hundred fellow devotees. One day, they came to the Jetavana monastery, and the bhikkhus, recognizing him,
            asked the Buddha, "For beings, is there any means of gaining longevity?" To this question the Buddha
            answered, "By respecting and honouring the elders and those who are wise and virtuous, one would gain not
            only longevity, but also beauty, happiness and strength."</li>
          <li>The Story of Culekasataka: When the bhikkhus heard about this, they asked the Buddha, "How is it that, in
            the case of this brahmin, a good deed done at present bears fruit immediately?" To them the Buddha replied
            "If the brahmin had offered his outer garment in the first watch of the night, he would have been rewarded
            with sixteen of each kind; if he had made his offering during the middle watch, he would have been rewarded
            with eight of each kind; since he had made his offering only during the last watch of the night, he was
            rewarded with only four of each kind." So, when one wants to give in charity, one should do so quickly; if
            one procrastinates, the reward comes slowly and only sparingly. Also, if one is too slow in doing good
            deeds, one may not be able to do it at all, for the mind tends to take delight in doing evil.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 193: It is hard to find the noblest of men; he is not born everywhere nor in every clan.
            To whatever clan such a wise man is born, that clan prospers. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 282: Indeed, wisdom is born of meditation; without meditation wisdom is lost. Knowing
            this twofold path of gain and loss of wisdom, one should conduct oneself so that wisdom may increase. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 290: If by giving up small pleasures great happiness is to be found, the wise should give
            up small pleasures seeing (the prospect of) great happiness. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 323: Indeed, not by any means of transport (such as elephants and horses) can one go to
            the place one has never been before (i.e., Nibbana); but by thoroughly taming oneself, the tamed one can get
            to that place (i.e., Nibbana).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 356: Weeds damage fields; lust spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from
            lust yields great benefit.
            Verse 357: Weeds damage fields; ill will spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from ill will
            yields great benefit.

          <li>Genesis 39-4, 5, 6: And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.</li>
          <li>Genesis 41-39, 40: And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</li>
          <li>Genesis 41-45, 46: And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</li>
          <li>Genesis 47-9, ..., 11: And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.</li>

            them, and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺1 and what was revealed before you, and
            have sure faith in the Hereafter. It is they who are ˹truly˺ guided by their Lord, and it is they who will

          <li>Quran 2-58: And ˹remember˺ when We said, “Enter this city and eat freely from wherever you please; enter the gate with humility, saying, ‘Absolve us.’ We will forgive your sins and multiply the reward for the good-doers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-200: When you have fulfilled your sacred rites, praise Allah as you used to praise your forefathers before Islam, or even more passionately. There are some who say "Our Lord! Grant us Your bounties in this world," but they will have no share in the Hereafter.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-245: Who will lend to Allah a good loan which Allah will multiply many times over? It is Allah ˹alone˺ who decreases and increases ˹wealth˺. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-261: The example of those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah is that of a grain that sprouts into seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains. And Allah multiplies ˹the reward even more˺ to whoever He wills. For Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing. </li>

          <li>Quran 4-46: Some Jews take words out of context and say, “We listen and we disobey,” “Hear! May you never hear,” and “Râ’ina!” [Herd us!]—playing with words and discrediting the faith. Had they said ˹courteously˺, “We hear and obey,” “Listen to us,” and “Unẓurna,” [Tend to us!] it would have been better for them and more proper.

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 46: One who knows that this body is impermanent like froth, and comprehends that it is
            insubstantial like a mirage will cut the flowers of Mara (i.e., the three kinds of vatta or rounds), and
            pass out of sight of the King of Death.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 90: For him (an arahat) whose journey is ended, who is free from sorrow and from all
            (e.g. khandha aggregates), who has destroyed all fetters, there is no more distress. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Asked by Jivaka: "Jivaka! Ever since I attained Buddhahood there has been no
            pain and distress for me."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 96: An arahat is calm in his mind, calm in his speech, and also in his deed; truly
            knowing the Dhamma, such an arahat is free from moral defilements and is unpurturbed by the ups and downs of
            life. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Three Daughters of Mara: Then, the Buddha continued, "Brahmin Magandiya, even when I saw
            those peerless daughters of Mara, I felt no sensual desire in me. After all, what is this body of your
            daughter? It is full of urine and filth; I don't like to touch it even with my foot!"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 201: Conquest begets enmity; the conquered live in misery; the peaceful live happily
            having renounced conquest and defeat. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 205: Having had the taste of solitude and the taste of Perfect Peace of Nibbana, one who
            drinks in the joy of the essence of the Dhamma is free from fear and evil. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 212: Affection begets sorrow, affection begets fear. For him who is free from affection
            there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him?</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 291: He who seeks his own happiness by inflicting pain on others, being entangled by
            bonds of enmity, cannot be free from enmity. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Bhikkhu from the Country of the Vajjis: As he looked towards the city, standing alone in
            the monastery, the bhikkhu felt lonely and dissatisfied with his lot. Softly, he murmured to himself, "There
            can be no one whose lot is worse than mine". At that instant, the spirit guarding the woods appeared to him,
            and said, "those beings in niraya envy the lot of the beings in the deva world; so also, people envy the lot
            of those who live alone in the woods." </li>
          <li>The Story on Imprisonment: To them the Buddha answered, "Bhikkhus! These bonds are nothing compared to
            those of craving for food and clothing, for riches and for family. Craving is a thousand times, a hundred
            thousand times stronger than those chains, hand-cuffs and cages. That is the reason why the wise cut off
            craving and renounce the world and enter the Order of the bhikkhus."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 384: When the brahmana is well-established in the two dhammas (i.e., the practice of
            Tranquillity and Insight Meditation), then, in that knowing one, all fetters are destroyed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 397: Him I call a brahmana, who has cut off all fetters and is fearless, who is beyond
            attachment and is free from moral defilements.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Certain Brahmin: To him the Buddha said, "This bhikkhu has laid down the burden (of the
            khandhas)." The brahmin took that to mean that his slave had become an arahat. So to make sure, he asked the
            Buddha whether it was true that the young bhikkhu had become an arahat, and the Buddha confirmed his
            statement</li>

            among men. Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them, and others, not possessing
            such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could
            our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there

          <li>Quran 10-41: If they deny you, then say, “My deeds are mine and your deeds are yours. You are free of what I do and I am free of what you do!” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-27: Allah makes the believers steadfast with the firm Word ˹of faith˺1 in this worldly life and the Hereafter. And Allah leaves the wrongdoers to stray. For Allah does what He wills. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-29: There is no blame on you if you enter public places1 where there is something of benefit for you. And Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-38: There is no blame on the Prophet for doing what Allah has ordained for him. That has been the way of Allah with those ˹prophets˺ who had gone before. And Allah’s command has been firmly decreed.</li>
          <li>Quran 47-20, 21: And the believers say, “If only a sûrah was revealed ˹allowing self-defence˺!” Yet when a precise sûrah is revealed, in which fighting is ˹explicitly˺ mentioned, you see those with sickness in their hearts staring at you like someone in the throes of death. It would have been better for them to obey and speak rightly. Then when fighting was ordained, it surely would have been better for them if they were true to Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 66-2: Allah has already ordained for you ˹believers˺ the way to absolve yourselves from your oaths.1 For Allah is your Guardian. And He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 74-11, ..., 31: And leave to me ˹O Prophet˺ the one I created all by Myself, and granted him abundant wealth, and children always by his side, and made life very easy for him. Yet he is hungry for more. I will make his fate unbearable, for he contemplated and determined ˹a degrading label for the Quran˺. May he be condemned! How evil was what he determined! May he be condemned even more! How evil was what he determined! Then he re-contemplated ˹in frustration˺, then frowned and scowled, then turned his back ˹on the truth˺ and acted arrogantly, saying, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but magic from the ancients. Soon I will burn him in Hell! And what will make you realize what Hell is? It does not let anyone live or die,1 scorching the skin. It is overseen by nineteen ˹keepers˺. We have appointed only ˹stern˺ angels as wardens of the Fire. And We have made their number only as a test for the disbelievers,1 so that the People of the Book will be certain, and the believers will increase in faith, and neither the People of the Book nor the believers will have any doubts, and so that those ˹hypocrites˺ with sickness in their hearts and the disbelievers will argue, “What does Allah mean by such a number?” In this way Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And none knows the forces of your Lord except He. And this ˹description of Hell˺ is only a reminder to humanity. </li>

            Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single gourd dish of drink,
            and
            living in his mean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow his joy
            to be affected by it. Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! (C.A. quote 188)

          <li>Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, "Tien, what are your wishes?" Tien, pausing as he was playing
            on
            his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and "My wishes," he said, "are different
            from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen." "What harm is there in that?" said the Master; "do
            you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes." Tien then said, "In this, the last month of spring,
            with
            the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six
            or
            seven boys, I would wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and return home singing." The
            Master heaved a sigh and said, "I give my approval to Tien." (C.A. quote 449)</li>

          <li>Quran 9-124: Whenever a sûrah is revealed, some of them ask ˹mockingly˺, “Which of you has this increased in faith?” As for the believers, it has increased them in faith and they rejoice.</li>
          <li>Quran 11-54, 55: All we can say is that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah to witness, and you too bear witness, that I ˹totally˺ reject whatever you associate with Him ˹in worship˺. So let all of you plot against me without delay! </li>
          <li>Quran 20-132: Bid your people to pray, and be diligent in ˹observing˺ it. We do not ask you to provide. It is We Who provide for you. And the ultimate outcome is ˹only˺ for ˹the people of˺ righteousness. </li>

          <li>Quran 35-23: You are only a warner. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-3: Indeed, sincere devotion is due ˹only˺ to Allah. As for those who take other lords besides Him, ˹saying,˺ “We worship them only so they may bring us closer to Allah,” surely Allah will judge between all1 regarding what they differed about. Allah certainly does not guide whoever persists in lying and disbelief. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-29: Allah sets forth the parable of a slave owned by several quarrelsome masters, and a slave owned by only one master. Are they equal in condition?1 Praise be to Allah! In fact, most of them do not know. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 35: The mind is difficult to control; swiftly and lightly, it moves and lands wherever
            it
            pleases. It is good to tame the mind, for a well-tamed mind brings happiness.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 51: Just as a beautiful flower, lacking in scent, cannot give the wearer the benefit of
            its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha cannot benefit one who does not practise the
            Dhamma.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 100: Better than a thousand words that are senseless and unconnected with the realization
            of Nibbana, is a single word of sense, if on hearing it one is calmed. </li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Rupananda (Janapadakalyani): "A thorn can only be taken out with a thorn; Rupananda
            being very attached to her body and being very proud of her beauty, I must take the pride and attachment out
            of her through beauty."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 159: One should act as one teaches others; only with oneself thoroughly tamed should one
            tame others. To tame oneself is, indeed, difficult. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Attadattha: The Buddha then said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus, those who love and revere
            me should act like Attadattha. You are not paying me homage by just offering flowers, perfumes and incense
            and by coming to see me; you pay me homage only by practising the Dhamma I have taught you, i.e., the
            Lokuttara Dhamma."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Lay-Disciple: Afterwards, the Buddha and his disciples returned to the Jetavana monastery.
            On the way, the bhikkhus remarked that it was so surprising that the Buddha should have directed those
            people to feed the young man before he gave the discourse. On hearing their remarks, the Buddha said,
            "Bhikkhus! What you said is true, but you do not understand that I have come here, all this distance of
            thirty yojanas, because I knew that he was in a fitting condition to take in the Dhamma. If he were feeling
            very hungry, the pangs of hunger might have prevented him from taking in the Dhamma fully. That man had been
            out looking for his ox the whole morning, and was very tired and also very hungry. Bhikkhus, after all,
            there is no ailment which is so difficult to bear as hunger."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Son of a Butcher: So the Buddha said, "My disciple! You are getting old; but you have not
            made any provisions of merit for your journey to the next existence; you should now find a support for
            yourself."</li>
          <li>The Story of Ekudana the Arahat: To them the Buddha said. "Bhikkhus! I do not say that a bhikkhu who has
            learnt much and talks much of the Dhamma is one who is versed in the Dhamma, (Dhammadhara)." One who has
            learnt very little and knows only one stanza of the Dhamma, but fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths, and
            is ever mindful is the one who is truly versed in the Dhamma."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 268 & 269: Not by silence does one become a muni, if one is dull and ignorant. Like one
            holding a pair of scales, the wise one takes what is good and rejects what is evil. For this reason he is a
            muni. He who understands both internal and external aggregates is also, for that reason, called a muni</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 372: There can be no concentration in one who lacks wisdom; there can be no wisdom in one
            who lacks concentration. He who has concentration as well as wisdom is, indeed, close to Nibbana.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 377: O bhikkhus! As the jasmin (vassika) plant sheds its withered flowers, so also,
            should you shed passion and ill will.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Vakkali: As a bhikkhu, Vakkali always kept close to the Buddha; he did not care much
            about other duties of a bhikkhu and did not at all practise concentration meditation. So, the Buddha said to
            him, "Vakkali, it will be of no use to you by always keeping close to me, looking at my face. You should
            practise concentration meditation; for, indeed, only the one who sees the Dhamma sees me. One who does not
            see the Dhamma does not see me. So, you must leave my presence."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 408: Him I call a brahmana, who speaks gentle, instructive and true words, and who does
            not offend anyone by speech.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Other bhikkhus misunderstood Thera Sariputta's instructions, and said to the
            Buddha, "Venerable Sir! Thera Sariputta is still attached to material things like robes and other requisites
            of a bhikkhu." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! My son Sariputta has no more craving in him. He told
            you to bring the robes to him, so that the chances to perform meritorious deeds may not decrease for
            lay-disciples, and the chances to accept whatever they may properly receive may not be reduced for young
            bhikkhus and samaneras."</li>

            his replies unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what practical use is it?" (C.A.

            coffin. (C.A. quote 405) The Master said, "Every one calls his son his son, whether he has talents or has
            not talents. There was Li; when he died, he had a coffin but no outer shell. I would not walk on foot to
            get
            a shell for him, because, having followed in the rear of the great officers, it was not proper that I

            Tsze-kung again asked, "If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which
            of them should be foregone?" The Master answered, "Part with the food. From of old, death has been the lot
            of an men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state. "(C.A.

            price (C.A. Quote 314)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "Since I cannot get men pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my
            instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. The ardent will advance and lay hold of
            truth; the cautiously-decided will keep themselves from what is wrong." (C.A. quote 548)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, "The mechanic, who wishes to do his work
            well, must first sharpen his tools. When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy
            among its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its scholars." (C.A. quote 647)</li>
          <li>I have been the whole day without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:-occupied with thinking.

          In language it is simply required that it convey the meaning (C.A. quote 685)
          <li>Pi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master was inclined to go. (C.A. quote 736) Tsze-lu said, "Master,
            formerly I have heard you say, 'When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a superior man will
            not associate with him.' Pi Hsi is in rebellion, holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him, what
            shall be said?" (C.A. quote 737) The Master said, "Yes, I did use these words. But is it not said, that,
            if
            a thing be really hard, it may be ground without being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be
            really
            white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made black? (C.A. quote 738)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, "Who are you sir?" He answered, "I am Chung Yu."
            "Are
            you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?" asked the other. "I am," replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to
            him, "Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its
            state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better
            follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and
            proceeded with his work, without stopping. (C.A. quote 785) Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when
            the Master observed with a sigh, "It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the
            same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associated? If right
            principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state." (C.A. quote
            786)
          </li>
          <li>Tsze-lu then said to the family, "Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and
            young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between
            sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to come to
            confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the
            failure
            of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that." (C.A. quote 791)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but
            if
            it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.
            Therefore, the superior man does not practice them." (C.A. quote 807)</li>

          <li>Genesis 30-40, ..., 43: And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.</li>

            Quran 2-142: The foolish among the people will ask, “Why did they turn away from the direction of prayer they used to face?”1 Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The east and west belong ˹only˺ to Allah. He guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.” 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-182: Whoever suspects an error or an injustice in the will and brings about a fair setlement among the parties will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-194: There will be no retaliation in a sacred month for an offence in a sacred month, and all violations will bring about retaliation. So, if anyone attacks you, retaliate in the same manner. But be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is with those mindful of Him.</li>
          <li>Quran 4-43: O believers! Do not approach prayer while intoxicated1 until you are aware of what you say, nor in a state of ˹full˺ impurity2—unless you merely pass through ˹the mosque˺—until you have bathed. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth, wiping your faces and hands.3 And Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.</li>
          <li>Quran 4-101: When you travel through the land, it is permissible for you to shorten the prayer1—˹especially˺ if you fear an attack by the disbelievers. Indeed, the disbelievers are your sworn enemies. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-140: He has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s revelations being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit in that company unless they engage in a different topic, or else you will be like them.1 Surely Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-141: He is the One Who produces gardens—both cultivated and wild1—and palm trees, crops of different flavours, olives, and pomegranates—similar ˹in shape˺, but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Eat of the fruit they bear and pay the dues at harvest, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-60: Alms-tax is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to administer it, for those whose hearts are attracted ˹to the faith˺, for ˹freeing˺ slaves, for those in debt, for Allah’s cause, and for ˹needy˺ travellers. ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-122: ˹However,˺ it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at once. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to gain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to them, so that they ˹too˺ may beware ˹of evil˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-35: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods guide to the truth?” Say, “˹Only˺ Allah guides to the truth.” Who then is more worthy to be followed: the One Who guides to the truth or those who cannot find the way unless guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge? </li>
          <li>Quran 13-14: Calling upon Him ˹alone˺ is the truth. But those ˹idols˺ the pagans invoke besides Him ˹can˺ never respond to them in any way. ˹It is˺ just like someone who stretches out their hands to water, ˹asking it˺ to reach their mouths, but it can never do so. The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain.</li>
          <li>Quran 14-12:  Why should we not put our trust in Allah, when He has truly guided us to ˹the very best of˺ ways? Indeed, we will patiently endure whatever harm you may cause us. And in Allah let the faithful put their trust.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-5: And He created the cattle for you as a source of warmth, food, and ˹many other˺ benefits. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-26: Indeed, those before them had plotted, but Allah struck at the ˹very˺ foundation of their structure, so the roof collapsed on top of them, and the torment came upon them from where they did not expect.1
          <li>Quran 16-73: Yet they worship besides Allah those ˹idols˺ who do not afford them any provision from the heavens and the earth, nor do they have the power to. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-81: And Allah has provided you shade out of what He created, and has given you shelter in the mountains. He has also provided you with clothes protecting you from the heat ˹and cold˺, and armour shielding you in battle. This is how He perfects His favour upon you, so perhaps you will ˹fully˺ submit ˹to Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-124: ˹Honouring˺ the Sabbath was ordained only for those who disputed about Abraham.1 And surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their disputes. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-126: If you retaliate, then let it be equivalent to what you have suffered. But if you patiently endure, it is certainly best for those who are patient. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-29:  Do not be so tight-fisted, for you will be blameworthy; nor so open-handed, for you will end up in poverty. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-62: There they will never hear any idle talk—only ˹greetings of˺ peace. And there they will have their provisions morning and evening.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 19-97: Indeed, We have made this ˹Quran˺ easy in your own language ˹O Prophet˺ so with it you may give good news to the righteous and warn those who are contentious. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-40: ˹They are˺ those who have been expelled from their homes for no reason other than proclaiming: “Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not repelled ˹the aggression of˺ some people by means of others, destruction would have surely claimed monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s Name is often mentioned. Allah will certainly help those who stand up for Him. Allah is truly All-Powerful, Almighty. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-73: O humanity! A lesson is set forth, so listen to it ˹carefully˺: those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah can never create ˹so much as˺ a fly, even if they ˹all˺ were to come together for that. And if a fly were to snatch anything away from them, they cannot ˹even˺ retrieve it from the fly. How powerless are those who invoke and those invoked!1</li>
          <li>Quran 23-96: Respond to evil with what is best. We know well what they claim.1</li>
          <li>Quran 27-80, 81: You certainly cannot make the dead hear ˹the truth˺. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away. Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe in Our revelations, ˹fully˺ submitting ˹to Allah˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-45: Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, ˹genuine˺ prayer should deter ˹one˺ from indecency and wickedness. The remembrance of Allah is ˹an˺ even greater ˹deterrent˺. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you ˹all˺ do. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-52: So you ˹O Prophet˺ certainly cannot make the dead hear ˹the truth˺. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away. </li>
          <li>Quran 63-6: It is the same whether you pray for their forgiveness or not, Allah will not forgive them. Surely Allah does not guide the rebellious people. </li>
          <li>Quran 67-15: He is the One Who smoothed out the earth for you, so move about in its regions and eat from His provisions. And to Him is the resurrection ˹of all˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 76-23: Indeed, it is We Who have revealed the Quran to you ˹O Prophet˺ in stages. </li>
          <li>Quran 87-6:  We will have you recite ˹the Quran, O  Prophet,˺ so you will not forget ˹any of it˺, </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 23: The wise, constantly cultivating Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice,
            being
            ever mindful and steadfastly striving, realize Nibbana: Nibbana, which is free from the bonds of yoga*;
            Nibbana, the Incomparable!</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 67: That deed is not well done, if one has to repent for having done it, and if, with a
            tearful face, one has to weep as a result of that deed. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Dhammika: "Bhikkhus, a wise man does not wish for wealth and prosperity by doing
            evil, whether it is for his own sake or for the sake of others. He only works for his own liberation from
            the round of rebirths (samsara) by comprehending the Dhamma and living according to the Dhamma."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 86: But those who practise according to the well-expounded Dhamma will reach the other
            shore (Nibbana), having passed the realm of Death (i.e., samsara), very difficult as it is to cross.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: "Bhikkhus, Sariputta's answer is simply this; he accepts the fact that
            Nibbana is realized by means of meditation on the senses, but his acceptance is due to his own personal
            realization and not merely because I have said it or somebody else has said it. Sariputta has faith in me;
            he also has faith in the consequences of good and bad deeds."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Padhanikatissa: To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! One who wants to teach others
            should first teach himself and conduct himself properly."</li>
          <li>The Story of Some Bhikkhus: The Buddha asked them, "Bhikkhus, have you attained Arahatta Phala?" Then they
            replied that they were in such a condition that it would not be difficult for them to attain Arahatta Phala
            at any time. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! Just because you are endowed with morality (sila), just
            because you have attained Anagami Phala, you should not be complacent and think that there is just a little
            more to be done; unless you have eradicated all moral intoxicants (asavas), you must not think that you have
            realized perfect bliss of Arahatta Fruition."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 315: As a border town is guarded both inside and outside, so guard yourself. Let not the
            right moment go by for those who miss this moment come to grief when they fall into niraya. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 333: It is good to have virtue till old age, it is good to have unshakable faith, it is
            good to gain wisdom, it is good to do no evil.</li>
          <li>The Story of Jatila, the Brahmin: But the Buddha rejected his view and said, "O brahmin, I do not call one
            a brahmana because he keeps his hair matted or simply because of his birth; I call one a brahmana only if he
            fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 414: Him I call a brahmana, who, having traversed this dangerous swamp (of passion), this
            difficult road (of moral defilements), the ocean of life (samsara) and the darkness of ignorance (moha), and
            having crossed the fourfold Flood, has reached the other shore (Nibbana); who practises Tranquility and
            Insight Meditation, who is free from craving and from doubt, who clings to nothing and remains in perfect
            peace.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 416: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has given up craving, and leaving the
            home-life has become a bhikkhu; who has eradicated craving and has come to the end of existence.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 423: Him I call a brahmana, who knows past existences, who sees the celestial as well as
            the lower worlds, who has reached the end of rebirths, who, with Magga Insight, has become an arahat and has
            accomplished all that is to be accomplished for the eradication of moral defilements.</li>

          <li>Tsze-yu said, "The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in
            answering and replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the
            branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as
            sufficiently taught?" (C.A. quote 815) Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, "Alas! Yen Yu is wrong.
            According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of
            prime
            importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to
            be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals
            with
            his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the
            sage
            alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?" (C.A. quote 816)</li>
          <li>It is from Music that the finish is recieved (C.A. quote 273)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to
            assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?" The Master said, "Why speak
            only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were
            still solicitous about this (C.A. quote 207)</li>

          <li>Quran 41-44: Had We revealed it as a non-Arabic Quran, they would have certainly argued, “If only its verses were made clear ˹in our language˺. What! A non-Arabic revelation for an Arab audience!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is a guide and a healing to the believers. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness in their ears and blindness to it ˹in their hearts˺. It is as if they are being called from a faraway place.”1 </li>
          <li>Quran 42-7: And so We have revealed to you a Quran in Arabic, so you may warn the Mother of Cities1 and everyone around it, and warn of the Day of Gathering—about which there is no doubt—˹when˺ a group will be in Paradise and another in the Blaze. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-11: And ˹He is the One˺ Who sends down rain from the sky in perfect measure, with which We give life to a lifeless land. And so will you be brought forth ˹from the grave˺. </li>

          <li>Quran 78-29, 30: And We have everything recorded precisely. ˹So the deniers will be told,˺ “Taste ˹the punishment˺, for all you will get from Us is more torment.” </li>
          <li>Quran 86-11, 12, 13: By the sky with its recurring cycles, and the earth with its sprouting plants!  Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a decisive word, </li> 
          <li>Quran 87-1, 2, 3: Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High, Who created and ˹perfectly˺ fashioned ˹all˺, and Who ordained precisely and inspired accordingly, </li>

          <li>Quran 2-179: There is security of life for you in the law of retaliation, O people of reason, so that you may become mindful of Allah.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-180: It is prescribed that when death approaches any of you-if they leave something of value-a will should be made in favour of parents and immediate family with fairness. This is an obligation on those who are mindful of Allah.</li>
          <li>Quran 3-161: It is not appropriate for a prophet to illegally withhold spoils of war. And whoever does so, it will be held against them on the Day of Judgment. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-6: Test ˹the competence of˺ the orphans until they reach a marriageable age. Then if you feel they are capable of sound judgment, return their wealth to them. And do not consume it wastefully and hastily before they grow up ˹to demand it˺. If the guardian is well-off, they should not take compensation; but if the guardian is poor, let them take a reasonable provision. When you give orphans back their property, call in witnesses. And sufficient is Allah as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-7: For men there is a share in what their parents and close relatives leave, and for women there is a share in what their parents and close relatives leave—whether it is little or much. ˹These are˺ obligatory shares. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-8: If ˹non-inheriting˺ relatives, orphans,1 or the needy are present at the time of distribution, offer them a ˹small˺ provision from it and speak to them kindly. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-1: They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺ believers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-41: Know that whatever spoils you take, one-fifth is for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and what We revealed to Our servant on that decisive day when the two armies met ˹at Badr˺. And Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-74, 75: Those who believed, migrated, and struggled in the cause of Allah, and those who gave ˹them˺ shelter and help, they are the true believers. They will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.  And those who later believed, migrated, and struggled alongside you, they are also with you. But only blood relatives are now entitled to inherit from one another, as ordained by Allah. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything.1</li>
          <li>Quran 9-31: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Who owns ˹your˺ hearing and sight?

          <li>Quran 11-42, 43:  And ˹so˺ the Ark sailed with them through waves like mountains. Noah called out to his son, who stood apart, “O my dear son! Come aboard with us and do not be with the disbelievers.” He replied, “I will take refuge on a mountain, which will protect me from the water.” Noah cried, “Today no one is protected from Allah’s decree except those to whom He shows mercy!” And the waves came between them, and his son was among the drowned. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-66: Jacob insisted, “I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn oath by Allah that you will certainly bring him back to me, unless you are totally overpowered.” Then after they had given him their oaths, he concluded, “Allah is a Witness to what we have said.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-43: We did not send ˹messengers˺ before you ˹O Prophet˺ except mere men inspired by Us. If you ˹polytheists˺ do not know ˹this already˺, then ask those who have knowledge ˹of the Scriptures˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-33: Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right.1 If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs2 the authority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation,3 for they are already supported ˹by law˺. </li>

And He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy, and We send down pure rain from the sky, giving life to a lifeless land, and providing water for countless animals and humans of Our Own creation. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-210, ..., 212: It was not the devils who brought this ˹Quran˺ down:  it is not for them ˹to do so˺, nor can they,  for they are strictly barred from ˹even˺ overhearing ˹it˺.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 33-51: O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom Allah has granted you.1 And ˹you are allowed to marry˺ the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts, who have emigrated like you. Also ˹allowed for marriage is˺ a believing woman who offers herself to the Prophet ˹without dowry˺ if he is interested in marrying her—˹this is˺ exclusively for you, not for the rest of the believers.2 We know well what ˹rulings˺ We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession. As such, there would be no blame on you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-53: O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.</li>
          <li>Quran 40-61: It is Allah Who has made the night for you to rest in and the day bright. Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most people are ungrateful. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 283: O bhikkhus, cut down the forest of craving, not the real tree; the forest of craving

            craving.
            Verse 284: So long as craving of man for woman is not cut down and the slightest trace of it remains, so

            sense objects) together with its revenue officer (i.e., attachment), the brahmana (i.e., the arahat) goes
            free from dukkha.

            bhikkhu is not of much benefit.
            Verse 313: If there is anything to be done, do it well; do it firmly and energetically; for the slack life
            of a bhikkhu scatters much dust (of moral defilements).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 369: O bhikkhu, bale out the water (of wrong thoughts) from this boat (your body); when

They cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion, “If You save us from this, we will certainly be grateful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-40: And when Our command came and the oven burst ˹with water˺,1 We said ˹to Noah˺, “Take into the Ark a pair from every species along with your family—except those against whom the decree ˹to drown˺ has already been passed—and those who believe.” But none believed with him except for a few. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-18: He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity. The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood. The ˹worthless˺ residue is then cast away, but what benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah sets forth parables. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-39: Allah eliminates and confirms what He wills, and with Him is the Master Record.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 15-19: As for the earth, We spread it out and placed upon it firm mountains, and caused everything to grow there in perfect balance. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-10: He is the One Who sends down rain from the sky, from which you drink and by which plants grow for your cattle to graze. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-15: He has placed into the earth firm mountains, so it does not shake with you, as well as rivers, and pathways so you may find your way. 
          <li>Quran 16-45, 46, 47: Do those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them? Or that the torment will not come upon them in ways they cannot comprehend? Or that He will not seize them while they go about ˹their day˺, for then they will have no escape? Or that He will not destroy them gradually? But your Lord is truly Ever Gracious, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-68, 69: And your Lord inspired the bees: “Make ˹your˺ homes in the mountains, the trees, and in what people construct, and feed from ˹the flower of˺ any fruit ˹you please˺ and follow the ways your Lord has made easy for you.” From their bellies comes forth liquid of varying colours, in which there is healing for people. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-92: Do not be like the woman who ˹foolishly˺ unravels her yarn after it is firmly spun, by taking your oaths as a means of deceiving one another in favour of a stronger group. Surely Allah tests you through this. And on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make your differences clear to you. 
          <li>Quran 18-96, 97: Bring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up ˹the gap˺ between the two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.” And so the enemies could neither scale nor tunnel through it. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-31, 32: And We have placed firm mountains upon the earth so it does not shake with them, and made in it broad pathways so they may find their way. And We have made the sky a well-protected canopy, still they turn away from its signs.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 22-63:  Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky, then the earth becomes green? Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-44:  Then We sent Our messengers in succession: whenever a messenger came to his people, they denied him. So We destroyed them, one after the other, reducing them to ˹cautionary˺ tales. So away with the people who refuse to believe! </li>
          <li>Quran 25-45, 46: Have you not seen how your Lord extends the shade—He could have simply made it ˹remain˺ still if He so willed—then We make the sun its guide, causing the shade to retreat gradually?1  </li>
          <li>Quran 25-54: And He is the One Who creates human beings from a ˹humble˺ liquid,1 then establishes for them bonds of kinship and marriage. For your Lord is Most Capable. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-88: Now you see the mountains, thinking they are firmly fixed, but they are travelling ˹just˺ like clouds. ˹That is˺ the design of Allah, Who has perfected everything. Surely He is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-48, 49: It is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up ˹vapour, forming˺ clouds, which He then spreads out in the sky or piles up into masses as He wills, from which you see rain come forth. Then as soon as He causes it to fall on whoever He wills of His servants, they rejoice,  although they had utterly lost hope just before it was sent down to them. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-50: Say, “If I am astray, the loss is only mine. And if I am guided, it is ˹only˺ because of what my Lord reveals to me. He is indeed All-Hearing, Ever Near.” </li>
          <li>Quran 35-25: If they deny you, so did those before them. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 36-80: ˹He is the One˺ Who gives you fire from green trees, and—behold!—you kindle ˹fire˺ from them.1</li>
          <li>Quran 39-21: Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky—channelling it through streams in the earth—then produces with it crops of various colours, then they dry up and you see them wither, and then He reduces them to chaff? Surely in this is a reminder for people of reason. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-38: If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “Allah!” Ask ˹them˺, “Consider then whatever ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah: if it was Allah’s Will to harm me, could they undo that harm? Or if He willed ˹some˺ mercy for me, could they withhold His mercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me. In Him ˹alone˺ the faithful put their trust.” </li>
          <li>Quran 39-43: Or have they taken others besides Allah as intercessors? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Would they do so,˺ even though those ˹idols˺ have neither authority nor intelligence?” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-64: It is Allah Who made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky a canopy. He shaped you ˹in the womb˺, perfecting your form. And He has provided you with what is good and lawful. That is Allah—your Lord. So Blessed is Allah, Lord of all worlds. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-29: Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are firm with the disbelievers1 and compassionate with one another. You see them bowing and prostrating2 ˹in prayer˺, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure. The sign ˹of brightness can be seen˺ on their faces from the trace of prostrating ˹in prayer˺. This is their description in the Torah.3 And their parable in the Gospel is that of a seed that sprouts its ˹tiny˺ branches, making it strong. Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the delight of the planters4—in this way Allah makes the believers a source of dismay for the disbelievers.5 To those of them who believe and do good, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward. </li>

          <li>Exodus 25-10: And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.</li>
          <li>Exodus 25-11, ..., 22: And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof. And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</li>

          <li>Exodus 35-25, 26: And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.</li>

            Quran 6-148: The polytheists will argue, “Had it been Allah’s Will, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated others with Him ˹in worship˺ or made anything unlawful.” Likewise, those before them rejected the truth until they tasted Our punishment. Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? Surely you follow nothing but ˹false˺ assumptions and you do nothing but lie.” 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 7-148: In the absence of Moses, his people made from their ˹golden˺ jewellery an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Path? Still they took it as a god and were wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-67, 68: And the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook the wrongdoers, so they fell lifeless in their homes, as if they had never lived there. Surely Thamûd denied their Lord, so away with Thamûd! </li>
          <li>Quran 13-31: If there were a recitation that could cause mountains to move, or the earth to split, or the dead to speak, ˹it would have been this Quran˺. But all matters are by Allah’s Will. Have the believers not yet realized that had Allah willed, He could have guided all of humanity? And disasters will continue to afflict the disbelievers or strike close to their homes for their misdeeds, until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Surely Allah never fails in His promise. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-32: It is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and sends down rain from the sky, causing fruits to grow as a provision for you. He has subjected the ships for your service, sailing through the sea by His command, and has subjected the rivers for you. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-25: Indeed, We created man from sounding clay moulded from black mud. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-27:  As for the jinn, We created them earlier from smokeless fire. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-73: So the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook them at sunrise. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-7: And they carry your loads to ˹distant˺ lands which you could not otherwise reach without great hardship. Surely your Lord is Ever Gracious, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-8: ˹He also created˺ horses, mules, and donkeys for your transportation and adornment. And He creates what you do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-11: With it He produces for you ˹various˺ crops, olives, palm trees, grapevines, and every type of fruit. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-14: And He is the One Who has subjected the sea, so from it you may eat tender seafood and extract ornaments to wear. And you see the ships ploughing their way through it, so you may seek His bounty and give thanks ˹to Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-44: ˹We sent them˺ with clear proofs and divine Books. And We have sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Reminder, so that you may explain to people what has been revealed for them, and perhaps they will reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-66, 67 And from the fruits of palm trees and grapevines you derive intoxicants1 as well as wholesome provision. Surely in this is a sign for those who understand. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-80: And Allah has made your homes a place to rest, and has given you tents from the hide of animals, light to handle when you travel and when you camp. And out of their wool, fur, and hair He has given you furnishings and goods for a while. 
          <li>Quran 17-66: It is your Lord Who steers the ships for you through the sea, so that you may seek His bounty. Surely He is ever Merciful to you. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-87, 88: They argued, “We did not break our promise to you of our own free will, but we were made to carry the burden of the people’s ˹golden˺ jewellery,1 then we threw it ˹into the fire˺, and so did the Sâmiri.” Then he moulded for them an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. They said, “This is your god and the god of Moses, but Moses forgot ˹where it was˺!” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-5: O humanity! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then ˹know that˺ We did create you1 from dust, then from a sperm-drop,2 then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot ˹of blood˺,3 then a lump of flesh4—fully formed or unformed5—in order to demonstrate ˹Our power˺ to you. ˹Then˺ We settle whatever ˹embryo˺ We will in the womb for an appointed term, then bring you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime. Some of you ˹may˺ die ˹young˺, while others are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell, producing every type of pleasant plant. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-12, 13, 14:  And indeed, We created humankind1 from an extract of clay,  then placed each ˹human˺ as a sperm-drop1 in a secure place, then We developed the drop into a clinging clot ˹of blood˺, then developed the clot into a lump ˹of flesh˺, then developed the lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, then We brought it into being as a new creation.1 So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-92, 93, 94, 95: ˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and unseen. Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Should You show me what they1 are threatened with, then, my Lord, do not count me among the wrongdoing people.” We are indeed able to show you what We have threatened them with. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-43: Do you not see that Allah gently drives the clouds, then joins them together, piling them up into masses, from which you see raindrops come forth? And He sends down from the sky mountains ˹of clouds˺ loaded with hail, pouring it on whoever He wills and averting it from whoever He wills. The flash of the clouds’ lightning nearly takes away eyesight. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-128, 129, 130: ˹Why˺ do you build a landmark on every high place in vanity, and construct castles, as if you are going to live forever, and act so viciously when you attack ˹others˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 30-22: And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your languages and colours. Surely in this are signs for those of ˹sound˺ knowledge. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-46: And one of His signs is that He sends the winds, ushering in good news ˹of rain˺ so that He may give you a taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and that you may seek His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-32: Do you not see that the ships sail ˹smoothly˺ through the sea by the grace of Allah so that He may show you some of His signs? Surely in this are signs for whoever is steadfast, grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 32-7, 8, 9: Who has perfected everything He created. And He originated the creation of humankind from clay.1  Then He made his descendants from an extract of a humble fluid, then He fashioned them and had a spirit of His Own ˹creation˺ breathed into them. And He gave you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-10, 11: Indeed, We granted David a ˹great˺ privilege from Us, ˹commanding:˺ “O mountains! Echo his hymns! And the birds as well.” We made iron mouldable for him, instructing: “Make full-length armour, ˹perfectly˺ balancing the links. And work righteousness ˹O family of David!˺. Indeed, I am All-Seeing of what you do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 34-18: We had also placed between them and the cities1 We showered with blessings ˹many small˺ towns within sight of one another. And We set moderate travel distances in between, ˹saying,˺ “Travel between them by day and night safely.” </li>
          <li>Quran 35-11: And ˹it is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ created you from dust,1 then ˹developed you˺ from a sperm-drop, then made you into pairs.2 No female ever conceives or delivers without His knowledge. And no one’s life is made long or cut short but is ˹written˺ in a Record.3 That is certainly easy for Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 35-27, 28:  Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky with which We bring forth fruits of different colours? And in the mountains are streaks of varying shades of white, red, and raven black; just as people, living beings, and cattle are of various colours as well. Of all of Allah’s servants, only the knowledgeable ˹of His might˺ are ˹truly˺ in awe of Him. Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Forgiving. </li>
          <li>Quran 36-36: Glory be to the One Who created all ˹things in˺ pairs—˹be it˺ what the earth produces, their genders, or what they do not know! </li>
          <li>Quran 36-41, 42:  Another sign for them is that We carried their ancestors ˹with Noah˺ in the fully loaded Ark, and created for them similar things to ride in. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-6: He created you ˹all˺ from a single soul,1 then from it He made its mate.2 And He produced for you four pairs of cattle.3 He creates you in the wombs of your mothers ˹in stages˺, one development after another, in three layers of darkness.4 That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be turned away? </li>
          <li>Quran 40-80: Also, you find in them ˹other˺ benefits.1 And by means of them you may reach destinations you desire. And you are carried upon ˹some of˺ them and upon ships. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-11: ˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you spouses from among yourselves, and ˹made˺ mates for cattle ˹as well˺—multiplying you ˹both˺. There is nothing like Him, for He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-10: the One˺ Who has laid out the earth for you, and set in it pathways for you so that you may find your way. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-12, 13: And ˹He is the One˺ Who created all ˹things in˺ pairs,1 and made for you ships and animals to ride so that you may sit firmly on their backs, and remember your Lord’s blessings once you are settled on them, saying, “Glory be to the One Who has subjected these for us, for we could have never done so ˹on our own˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-12: Allah is the One Who has subjected the sea for you so that ships may sail upon it by His command, and that you may seek His bounty, and that perhaps you will be grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-7: As for the earth, We spread it out and placed upon it firm mountains, and produced in it every type of pleasant plant— ˹all as˺ an insight and a reminder to every servant who turns ˹to Allah˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-49: And We created pairs of all things1 so perhaps you would be mindful. </li>
          <li>Quran 55-14, 15: He created humankind from ˹sounding˺ clay like pottery, and created jinn from a ˹smokeless˺ flame of fire. </li>
          <li>Quran 55-19, 20: He merges the two bodies of ˹fresh and salt˺ water, yet between them is a barrier they never cross.1</li>
          <li>Quran 55-22: Out of both ˹waters˺ come forth pearls and coral. </li>
          <li>Quran 55-24: To Him belong the ships with raised sails, sailing through the seas like mountains. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-24: He is Allah: the Creator, the Inventor, the Shaper. He ˹alone˺ has the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth ˹constantly˺ glorifies Him. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 64-3: He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He shaped you ˹in the womb˺, perfecting your form. And to Him is the final return. </li>
          <li>Quran 64-4: He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And He knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. For Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. </li>
          <li>Quran 67-19: Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their wings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 75-3, 4: Do people think We cannot reassemble their bones? Yes ˹indeed˺! We are ˹most˺ capable of restoring ˹even˺ their very fingertips.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 76-28: It is We Who created them and perfected their ˹physical˺ form. But if We will, We can easily replace them with others. </li>
          <li>Quran 79-27, ..., 33: Which is harder to create: you or the sky?1 He built it, raising it high and forming it flawlessly.  He dimmed its night, and brought forth its daylight. As for the earth, He spread it out as well,1 bringing forth its water and pastures and setting the mountains firmly ˹upon it˺— all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 117: If a man does evil, he should not do it again and again; he should not take delight
            in it; the accumulation of evil leads to dukkha. </li>
          <li>The Story of a Careless Bhikkhu: "Bhikkhu, you should not behave in this way: you should not think lightly
            of an evil, however small it may be, because it will become big if you do it habitually."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 121: One should not think lightly of doing evil, imagining "A little will not affect me";
            just as a water-jar is filled up by falling drops of rain, so also, the fool is filled up with evil, by
            accumulating it little by little.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 158: One should first establish oneself in what is proper; then only one should teach
            others. A wise man should not incur reproach.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 314: It is better not to do an evil deed; an evil deed torments one later on. It is
            better to do a good deed as one does not have to repent for having done it.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 338: Just as a tree with roots undamaged and firm grows again even though cut down, so
            also, if latent craving is not rooted out, this dukkha (of birth, ageing and death) arises again and again.
            Verse 339: That man of wrong views, in whom the thirty-six streams (of craving) that flow towards
            pleasurable objects are strong, is carried away by his many thoughts connected with passion.
            Verse 340: The stream of craving flows towards all sense objects; the creeper of craving arises (at the six
            sense-doors) and fixes itself (on the six sense objects). Seeing that creeper of craving growing, cut off
            its roots with Magga Insight.
            Verse 341: In beings, there flows happiness that is smeared with craving; those beings attached to pleasure
            and seeking pleasure are, indeed, subject to birth and ageing.
            Verse 342: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare; held fast by fetters and
            bonds they undergo dukkha (round of rebirths) again and again, for a long time.
            Verse 343: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare. Therefore, One who wishes
            to free himself from craving should eradicate craving.</li>

            The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, "Who say that the son

            have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions

          <li>Quran 89-6, ..., 14: Did you not see how your Lord dealt with ’Ȃd— ˹the people˺ of Iram—with ˹their˺ great stature, unmatched in any other land;  and Thamûd who carved ˹their homes into˺ the rocks in the ˹Stone˺ Valley;  and the Pharaoh of mighty structures?1  They all transgressed throughout the land,  spreading much corruption there.  So your Lord unleashed on them a scourge of punishment.1 </li>

      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 16: Here he rejoices, hereafter he rejoices; one who performed meritorious deeds
            rejoices
            in both existences. He rejoices and greatly rejoices when he sees the purity of his own deeds.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 18: Here he is happy, hereafter he is happy; one who performs meritorious deeds is
            happy
            in both existences. Happily he exclaims: I have done meritorious deeds." He is happier still when he is
            reborn in a higher world (suggati).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 30: Through mindfulness (in doing meritorious deeds) Magha became king of the devas.
            Mindfulness is always praised, but negligence is always blamed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 107: For a hundred years, a man may tend the sacred fire in the forest: yet if, only for
            a moment, one pays homage to a bhikkhu who has practised Insight Development, this homage is, indeed, better
            than a hundred years of making sacrifices (in fire-worship). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 118: If a man does what is good, he should do it again and again; he should take delight
            in it; the accumulation of merit leads to happiness. </li>
          <li>The Story of Culakala Upasaka: When the Buddha was told about it, he said to Culakala, "You have been let
            off not only because the slave girls said that you were not the thief but also because you did not steal and
            was therefore innocent. Those who do evil go to niraya, but those who do good are reborn in the deva worlds
            or else realize Nibbana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 195: He pays homage to those who are worthy of veneration, whether they are the Buddhas
            or their disciples who have overcome obstacles (to Insight Development) and have rid themselves of sorrow
            and lamentation.
            Verse 196: The merit gained by such a person who pays homage to those who have been freed from moral
            defilements and have nothing to fear, cannot be measured by anyone, as this much or that much.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 219: A man who has long been absent and has returned home safely from a distance is
            welcomed with joy by relatives, friends and well-wishers on his return.
            Verse 220: In the same way, his good deeds will receive him who has done good when he goes from this world
            to the other, as relatives receive a dear one on his return.</li>
          <li>The Story of Citta, the Householder: The Venerable Ananda, seeing how Citta's riches were being
            replenished, asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! is it only when Citta approached you that he is blessed with
            all these riches? Is he similarly blessed when he goes somewhere else?" To him the Buddha replied, "Ananda,
            this disciple is fully endowed with faith and generosity; he is also virtuous and his reputation spreads far
            and wide. Such a one is sure to be revered and showered with riches wherever he goes."</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera Samkicca: the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, if you rob or steal and commit all sorts of
            evil deeds, your life would be useless, even if you were to live a hundred years. Living a virtuous life
            even for a single day is much better than a hundred years of a life of depravity.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 110: Better than a hundred years in the life of an immoral person who has no control over
            his senses, is a day in the life of a virtuous person who cultivates Tranquillity and Insight Development
            Practice. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 122: One should not think lightly of doing good, imagining 'A little will not affect me';
            just as a water-jar is filled up by falling drops of rain, so also, the wise one is filled up with merit, by
            accumulating it little by little. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Raised by Thera Maha Moggallana: To him the Buddha answered, "My son, why do you
            ask? Have you not seen for yourself and heard what the devas said? You should not have any doubt. Little
            deeds of merit surely lead one to the world of the devas."</li>

          <li>Yao said, "Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-determined order of succession now rests in your person. Sincerely

            will

            Quran 2-25: Give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to those who believe and do good that they will have Gardens under
            which rivers flow. Whenever provided with fruit, they will say, “This is what we were given before,” for
            they will be served fruit that looks similar ˹but tastes different˺. They will have pure spouses,1 and they
            will be there forever.
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-62: Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians1—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.2  </li>
          <li>Quran 2-82: And those who believe and do good will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-57: As for those who believe and do good, We will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. There they will have pure spouses,1 and We will place them under a vast shade. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-5: Today all good, pure foods have been made lawful for you. Similarly, the food of the People of the Book1 is permissible for you and yours is permissible for them. And ˹permissible for you in marriage˺ are chaste believing women as well as chaste women of those given the Scripture before you—as long as you pay them their dowries in wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as mistresses. And whoever rejects the faith, all their good deeds will be void ˹in this life˺ and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-85: So Allah will reward them for what they said with Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. And that is the reward of the good-doers. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-88: This is Allah’s guidance with which He guides whoever He wills of His servants. Had they associated others with Him ˹in worship˺, their ˹good˺ deeds would have been wasted. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-160: Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded tenfold. But whoever comes with a bad deed will be punished for only one. None will be wronged. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-57: And the reward of the Hereafter is far better for those who are faithful and are mindful ˹of Allah˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-29: Those who believe and do good, for them will be bliss and an honourable destination.” </li>
          <li>Quran 19-85: ˹Watch for˺ the Day We will gather the righteous before the Most Compassionate as an honoured delegation, </li>
          <li>Quran 19-96: As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will ˹certainly˺ bless them with ˹genuine˺ love. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-102: As for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, it is they who will be successful. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-70: As for those who repent, believe, and do good deeds, they are the ones whose evil deeds Allah will change into good deeds. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-89:  Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better, and they will be secure from the horror on that Day. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-27: We blessed him with Isaac and ˹later˺ Jacob, and reserved prophethood and revelation for his descendants. We gave him his reward in this life,1 and in the Hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-16: ˹Luqmân  added,˺ “O my dear son! ˹Even˺ if a deed were the weight of a mustard seed—be it ˹hidden˺ in a rock or in the heavens or the earth—Allah will bring it forth. Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-40: Whoever does an evil deed will only be paid back with its equivalent. And whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, they will enter Paradise, where they will be provided for without limit. </li>
          <li>Quran 47-2: As for those who believe, do good, and have faith in what has been revealed to Muḥammad—which is the truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their sins and improve their condition. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-39, 40: So be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset. And glorify Him during part of the night1 and after the prayers. </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 26: The foolish and the ignorant give themselves over to negligence; whereas the wise
            treasure mindfulness as a precious jewel.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 61: If a person seeking a companion cannot find one who is better than or equal to him,
            let him resolutely go on alone; there can be no companionship with a fool. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 78: One should not associate with bad friends, nor with the vile. One should associate
            with good friends, and with those who are noble. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 79: He who drinks in the Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind; the wise man always
            takes delight in the Dhamma (Bodhipakkhiya Dhamma) expounded by the Noble Ones (ariyas). </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Angulimala: Other bhikkhus asked the Buddha where Angulimala was reborn, and when the
            Buddha replied "My son has realized parinibbana", they could hardly believe it. So they asked him whether it
            was possible that a man who had killed so many people could have realized parinibbana. To this question, the
            Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Angulimala had done much evil because he did not have good friends. But later, he
            found good friends and through their help and good advice he had been steadfast and mindful in his practice
            of the dhamma. Therefore, his evil deeds have been overwhelmed by good (i e., Arahatta Magga).</li>
          <li>The Story of the Unrivalled Alms-Giving: On seeing the king, the Buddha said, "Great King! You should
            rejoice that you have succeeded in making the offering of the unrivalled charity (asadisadana). Such an
            opportunity comes very rarely; it comes only once during the appearance of each Buddha. But your minister
            Kala had felt that it was a waste, and was not at all appreciative. So, if I had given a lengthy discourse,
            he would get more and more dissatisfied and uncomfortable, and in consequence, he would suffer much more in
            the present existence as well as in the next. That was why I preached so briefly."
            Then the Buddha added, "Great King! Fools do not rejoice in the charities given by others and go to the
            lower worlds. The wise rejoice in other people's charities and through appreciation, they share in the merit
            gained by others and go to the abode of the devas".</li>
          <li>The Story of Nandiya: To him the Buddha said, "My son, why do you ask? Have you not yourself seen the
            mansion and riches waiting for Nandiya in the Tavatimsa deva world? The devas await the coming of the good
            and generous ones, as relatives await the return of one who is long absent. When the good ones die, they are
            welcomed joyously to the abode of the devas."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 328: If one finds a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one
            should live with him joyfully and mindfully, overcoming all dangers.
            Verse 329: If one cannot find a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one should live
            alone like the king who gave up and left the country he had won, and like the elephant Matanga roaming alone
            in the forest.
            Verse 330: It is better to live alone; there is no fellowship with a fool. So one should live alone, do no
            evil, and be carefree like the elephant Matanga roaming alone in the forest.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 331: It is good to have friends when the need arises; it is good to be content with
            anything that is available; it is good to have merit when life is about to end; it is good to be rid of all
            dukkha.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 354: The gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts; the taste of the Dhamma excels all tastes;
            delight in the Dhamma excels all delights. The eradication of Craving (i.e., attainment of arahatship)
            overcomes all ills (samsara dukkha).</li>
          <li>The Story of the Questions Raised by Sakka: At the end of the discourse, Sakka said to the Buddha,
            "Venerable Sir, if the gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts why are we not invited to share the merit
            whenever gifts of the Dhamma are made? Venerable Sir! I pray that, from now on, we may be given a share in
            the merit of good deeds".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 376: Associate with good friends, who are energetic and whose livelihood is pure; let him
            be amiable and be correct in his conduct. Then, (frequently) feeling much joy he will make an end of dukkha
            (of the round of rebirths).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 379: O bhikkhu, by yourself exhort yourself, and examine yourself; thus guarding yourself
            and being mindful, you will live in peace.
            Verse 380: One indeed is one's own refuge, (how could anyone else be one's refuge?) One indeed is one's own
            heaven; therefore, look after yourself as a horse dealer looks after a thoroughbred.</li>

            enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends:-these
            are
            advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to
            find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:-these are injurious (C.A. quote 707)</li>
          <li>Ch'an K'ang asked Po-yu, saying, "Have you heard any lessons from your father different from what we

            all heard?" (C.A. quote 718) Po-yu replied, "No. He was standing alone once, when I passed below the hall
            with hasty steps, and said to me, "Have you learned the Odes?' On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, If you
            do
            not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with.' I retired and studied the Odes. (C.A. quote
            719)
            Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and
            said to me, 'Have you learned the rules of Propriety?' On my replying 'Not yet,' he added, "If you do not
            learn the rules of Propriety, your character cannot be established.' I then retired, and learned the rules
            of Propriety. (C.A. quote 720) I have heard only these two things from him. (C.A. quote 721) Ch'ang K'ang
            retired, and quite delighted, said, "I asked one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about
            the
            Odes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also heard that the superior man maintains a

            'Associate with those who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot do so." Tsze-chang
            observed,
            "This is different from what I have learned. The superior man honors the talented and virtuous, and bears
            with all. He praises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?-who
            is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-men will put me away from

And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

            Quran 2-165: Still there are some who take others as Allah's equal-they love them as they should love Allah-but the true believers love Allah even more. If only the wrongdoers could see the horrible punishmnet awaiting them, they would certainly realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.

          <li>Quran 2-228: Divorced women must wait three monthly cycles ˹before they can re-marry˺. It is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs,1 if they ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day.

Women have rights similar to those of men equitably, although men have a degree ˹of responsibility˺ above them. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-234: As for those of you who die and leave widows behind, let them observe a waiting period of four months and ten days.

This is for your own good, if you are ˹truly˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-155: Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment and, when they were seized by an earthquake,1 he cried, “My Lord! Had You willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test from You—by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide whoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best forgiver. </li>

          <li>Quran 8-53: This is because Allah would never discontinue His favour to a people until they discontinue their faith. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-117: Allah has certainly turned in mercy to the Prophet1 as well as the Emigrants and the Helpers who stood by him in the time of hardship, after the hearts of a group of them had almost faltered.

          <li>Quran 18-94, 95: They pleaded, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Surely Gog and Magog1 are spreading corruption throughout the land.

But assist me with resources, and I will build a barrier between you and them. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-19, 20: To Him belong all those in the heavens and the earth. And those nearest to Him are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they tire. They glorify ˹Him˺ day and night, never wavering. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-60: That is so. And whoever retaliates in equivalence to the injury they have received, and then are wronged ˹again˺, Allah will certainly help them. Surely Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving. </li>

          <li>Quran 29-31, 32, 33: When Our messenger-angels came to Abraham with the good news ˹of the birth of Isaac˺, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this city ˹of Sodom˺, for its people have persisted in wrongdoing.” He said, “But Lot is there!” They responded, “We know best who is there. We will certainly save him and his family—except his wife, who is one of the doomed.” And when Our messenger-angels came to Lot, he was distressed and worried by their arrival.1 They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not fear, nor grieve. We will surely deliver you and your family—except your wife, who is one of the doomed. </li>
          <li>Quran 36-20, 21: Then from the farthest end of the city a man came, rushing. He advised, “O my people! Follow the messengers. Follow those who ask no reward of you, and are ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-61: And Allah will deliver those who were mindful ˹of Him˺ to their place of ˹ultimate˺ triumph. No evil will touch them, nor will they grieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-34, 35: Good and evil cannot be equal. Respond ˹to evil˺ with what is best, then the one you are in a feud with will be like a close friend. But this cannot be attained except by those who are patient and who are truly fortunate. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-15: Because of that, you ˹O Prophet˺ will invite ˹all˺. Be steadfast as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires. And say, “I believe in every Scripture Allah has revealed. And I am commanded to judge fairly among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We will be accountable for our deeds and you for yours. There is no ˹need for˺ contention between us. Allah will gather us together ˹for judgment˺. And to Him is the final return.” </li>
          <li>Quran 44-3: Indeed, We sent it down on a blessed night,1 for We always warn ˹against evil˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 60-4: You already have an excellent example in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, “We totally dissociate ourselves from you and ˹shun˺ whatever ˹idols˺ you worship besides Allah. We reject you. The enmity and hatred that has arisen between us and you will last until you believe in Allah alone.” The only exception is when Abraham said to his father, “I will seek forgiveness for you,˹” adding, “but˺ I cannot protect you from Allah at all.” ˹The believers prayed,˺ “Our Lord! In You we trust. And to You we ˹always˺ turn. And to You is the final return. </li>
          <li>Quran 60-7: ˹In time,˺ Allah may bring about goodwill between you and those of them you ˹now˺ hold as enemies. For Allah is Most Capable. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 62-2, 3: He is the One Who raised for the illiterate ˹people˺ a messenger from among themselves—reciting to them His revelations, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and wisdom, for indeed they had previously been clearly astray— along with others of them who have not yet joined them ˹in faith˺. For He is the Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 65-11: ˹and sent˺ a messenger reciting to you Allah’s revelations, making things clear so that He may bring those who believe and do good out of darkness and into light. And whoever believes in Allah and does good will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah will have indeed granted them an excellent provision. </li>

          <li>The Story of Thera Mahapanthaka: It was in this connection that, on one occasion, the bhikkhus asked the

            like ill will in them?" To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Arahats have no moral defilements like
            passion and ill will in them. My son Mahapanthaka acted as he did with a view to benefiting his brother and

You are also forbidden to draw lots for decisions.1 This is all evil. Today the disbelievers have given up all hope of ˹undermining˺ your faith. So do not fear them; fear Me!

And if any of those ˹bondspeople˺ in your possession desires a deed of emancipation, make it possible for them, if you find goodness in them.

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 106: Month after month for a hundred years, one may make offerings (to ordinary people)
            to the value of a thousand Kahapanas; yet if, only for a moment one pays homage to a bhikkhu who has

            soil, so you reap poorly."</li>

            Quran 2-110: Establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will ˹certainly˺ find ˹its reward˺ with Allah. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.

          <li>
            Quran 2-195: Spend in the cause of Allah and do not let your own hands throw you into destruction by withholding. And do good, for Allah certainly loves the good-doers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quran 2-148: Everyone turns to their own direction ˹of prayer˺. So compete with one another in doing good. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together ˹for judgment˺. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-215: They ask you ˹O Prophet in˺ what ˹way˺ they should donate. Say, “Whatever donations you give are for parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers. Whatever good you do is certainly well known to Allah.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-262: Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah and do not follow their charity with reminders of their generosity or hurtful words—they will get their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-263: Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-264: O believers! Do not waste your charity with reminders ˹of your generosity˺ or hurtful words, like those who donate their wealth just to show off and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Their example is that of a hard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil hit by a strong rain—leaving it just a bare stone. Such people are unable to preserve the reward of their charity. Allah does not guide ˹such˺ disbelieving people. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-265: And the example of those who donate their wealth, seeking Allah’s pleasure and believing the reward is certain,1 is that of a garden on a fertile hill: when heavy rain falls, it yields up twice its normal produce. If no heavy rain falls, a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-273: ˹Charity is˺ for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of Allah to move about in the land ˹for work˺. Those unfamiliar with their situation will think they are not in need ˹of charity˺ because they do not beg. You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not beg people persistently. Whatever you give in charity is certainly well known to Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-92: You will never achieve righteousness until you donate some of what you cherish. And whatever you give is certainly well known to Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-114: They believe in Allah and the Last Day, encourage good and forbid evil, and race with one another in doing good. They are ˹truly˺ among the righteous. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-103:  Take from their wealth ˹O Prophet˺ charity to purify and bless them, and pray for them—surely your prayer is a source of comfort for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-26:  Give to close relatives their due, as well as the poor and ˹needy˺ travellers. And do not spend wastefully. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-89, 90:  And ˹remember˺ when Zachariah cried out to his Lord, “My Lord! Do not leave me childless, though You are the Best of Successors.”1 So We answered his prayer, granted him John, and made his wife fertile. Indeed, they used to race in doing good, and call upon Us with hope and fear, totally humbling themselves before Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-28: so they may obtain the benefits ˹in store˺ for them,1 and pronounce the Name of Allah on appointed days over the sacrificial animals He has provided for them. So eat from their meat and feed the desperately poor. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-39: Whatever loans you give, ˹only˺ seeking interest at the expense of people’s wealth1 will not increase with Allah. But whatever charity you give, ˹only˺ seeking the pleasure of Allah—it is they whose reward will be multiplied. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-10: He created the heavens without pillars—as you can see—and placed firm mountains upon the earth so it does not shake with you, and scattered throughout it all types of creatures. And We send down rain from the sky, causing every type of fine plant to grow on earth. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-39: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely ˹it is˺ my Lord ˹Who˺ gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. And whatever you spend in charity, He will compensate ˹you˺ for it. For He is the Best Provider.” </li>
          <li>Quran 42-28:  He is the One Who sends down rain after people have given up hope, spreading out His mercy. He is the Guardian, the Praiseworthy. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-19: And in their wealth there was a rightful share ˹fulfilled˺ for the beggar and the poor. </li>
          <li>Quran 57-21: ˹So˺ compete with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-12: O believers! When you consult the Messenger privately, give something in charity before your consultation. That is better and purer for you. But if you lack the means, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 63-10: And donate from what We have provided for you before death comes to one of you, and you cry, “My Lord! If only You delayed me for a short while, I would give in charity and be one of the righteous.” </li>
          <li>Quran 76-8, 9:  and give food—despite their desire for it—to the poor, the orphan, and the captive, ˹saying to themselves,˺ “We feed you only for the sake of Allah, seeking neither reward nor thanks from you. </li>

          <li>Genesis 44-1, ..., 34: And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</li>
          <li>Exodus 2-11, ..., 15: And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</li>
          <li>Exodus 5-1: And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</li>

And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-177: Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west. Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, needy travellers, beggars, and for freeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges they make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in the heat of battle. It is they who are true in faith, and it is they who are mindful of Allah.</li>

          <li>Quran 5-48: We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-79:  They did not forbid one another from doing evil. Evil indeed was what they did! </li>

Yet remind them by this ˹Quran˺, so no one should be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have no protector or intercessor other than Allah. Even if they were to offer every ˹possible˺ ransom, none will be accepted from them. Those are the ones who will be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have a boiling drink and painful punishment for their disbelief. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-90: These ˹prophets˺ were ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah, so follow their guidance. Say, “I ask no reward of you for this ˹Quran˺—it is a reminder to the whole world.” </li>

And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-164: When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.” </li>

Say, “I have only been commanded to worship Allah, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺. To Him I invite ˹all˺, and to Him is my return.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-52: This ˹Quran˺ is a ˹sufficient˺ message for humanity so that they may take it as a warning and know that there is only One God, and so that people of reason may be mindful. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-71: And Allah has favoured some of you over others in provision. But those who have been much favoured would not share their wealth with those ˹bondspeople˺ in their possession, making them their equals.1 Do they then deny Allah’s favours? </li>

          <li>Quran 28-75: And We will bring forth a witness1 from every faith-community and ask ˹the polytheists˺, “Show ˹Us˺ your proof.” Then they will ˹come to˺ know that the truth is with Allah ˹alone˺. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-38: So give your close relatives their due, as well as the poor and the ˹needy˺ traveller. That is best for those who seek the pleasure of Allah,1 and it is they who will be successful. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-33: O humanity! Be mindful of your Lord, and beware of a Day when no parent will be of any benefit to their child, nor will a child be of any benefit to their parent. Surely Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver1 deceive you about Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 35-14: We have surely sent you with the truth as a deliverer of good news and a warner. There is no community that has not had a warner.1</li>
          <li>Quran 37-147, 148: We ˹later˺ sent him ˹back˺ to ˹his city of˺ at least one hundred thousand people, who then believed ˹in him˺, so We allowed them enjoyment for a while. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-13: He has ordained for you ˹believers˺ the Way which He decreed for Noah, and what We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what We decreed for Abraham, Moses, and Jesus,1 ˹commanding:˺ “Uphold the faith, and make no divisions in it.” What you call the polytheists to is unbearable for them. Allah chooses for Himself whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns ˹to Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-64: Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him ˹alone˺. This is the Straight Path.” </li>

          <li>Quran 45-28: And you will see every faith-community on its knees. Every community will be summoned to its record ˹of deeds˺. ˹They all will be told,˺ “This Day you will be rewarded for what you used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 49-10: The believers are but one brotherhood, so make peace between your brothers. And be mindful of Allah so you may be shown mercy. </li>
          <li>Quran 49-13: O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware</li>
          <li>Quran 67-24: ˹Also˺ say, “He is the One Who has dispersed you ˹all˺ over the earth, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be gathered.” </li>
          <li>Quran 68-52: But it is simply a reminder to the whole world. </li>
          <li>Quran 80-1, ..., 10: He frowned and turned ˹his attention˺ away, ˹simply˺ because the blind man came to him ˹interrupting˺.1  You never know ˹O Prophet˺, perhaps he may be purified, or he may be mindful, benefitting from the reminder. As for the one who was indifferent, you gave him your ˹undivided˺ attention, even though you are not to blame if he would not be purified. But as for the one who came to you, eager ˹to learn˺, being in awe ˹of Allah˺,  you were inattentive to him. </li>
          <li>Quran 84-6: O humanity! Indeed, you are labouring restlessly towards your Lord, and will ˹eventually˺ meet the consequences. </li>
          <li>Quran 103-1, 2, 3: By the ˹passage of˺ time! Surely humanity is in ˹grave˺ loss, except those who have faith, do good, and urge each other to the truth, and urge each other to perseverance. </li>

          <li>The Story of Kanamata: "Bhikkhus, the mind of Kana which was foggy and muddled was made clear and calm
            by my words."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 82: Like a lake which is deep, clear and calm, the wise after listening to the Teaching
            (Dhamma) become serene. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 98: In a village or in a forest, in a valley or on a hill, wherever arahats dwell, that
            place is delightful. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 344: Having left the forest of desire (i.e., the life of a householder), he takes to the
            forest of the practice (i.e., the life of a bhikkhu); but when he is free from the forest of desire he
            rushes back to that very forest. Come, look at that man who having become free rushes back into that very
            bondage. </li>
          <li>The Story of a Great Many Bhikkhus: The leader of the gang of thieves who was close at hand heard
            everything the lady had said and he was extremely surprised. Her words also kept him thinking, "If we take
            away the property of this wise and noble person, we will surely be punished; we might even be struck by
            lightning and our heads broken into many pieces." The leader got alarmed over this possibility and he
            hurried back to the house of the lady and made his followers return all the things they had taken. He then
            took all his followers to where the mistress of the house was; she was still at the pavilion, listening
            attentively to the Dhamma.</li>

          <li>Of superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu, how could this man have
            acquired this character? (C.A. quote 135)</li>
          <li>"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, and employed Kai-yao-on
            which all who were devoid of virtue disappeared. T'ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from
            among all the people, and employed I Yin-and all who were devoid of virtue disappeared." (C.A. quote 504)
          </li>

          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Chau's wickedness was not so great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man
            hates to dwell in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will flow in upon him." (C.A.

            Genesis 3-6: And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
          </li>
          <li>Genesis 33-13, ..., 16: And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</li>
          <li>Exodus 3-11, ..., 18: And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
          <li>Exodus 34-15, 16, 17: Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.</li>
          <li>Exodus 35-21: And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.</li>
          <li>Leviticus 10-13, 14: And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded. And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-143: And so We have made you ˹believers˺ an upright1 community so that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be a witness over you. We assigned your former direction of prayer only to distinguish those who would remain faithful to the Messenger from those who would lose faith. It was certainly a difficult test except for those ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah. And Allah would never discount your ˹previous acts of˺ faith. Surely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-84: So fight in the cause of Allah ˹O Prophet˺. You are accountable for none but yourself. And motivate the believers ˹to fight˺, so perhaps Allah will curb the disbelievers’ might. And Allah is far superior in might and in punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-82: You will surely find the most bitter towards the believers to be the Jews and polytheists and the most gracious to be those who call themselves Christian. That is because there are priests and monks among them and because they are not arrogant. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-22: Do not let the people of virtue and affluence among you swear to suspend donations to their relatives, the needy, and the emigrants in the cause of Allah. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love to be forgiven by Allah? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 85-1, ..., 10: By the sky full of constellations,  and the promised Day ˹of Judgment˺,  and the witness and what is witnessed!1  Condemned are the makers of the ditch—  the fire ˹pit˺, filled with fuel—  when they sat around it,  watching what they had ˹ordered to be˺ done to the believers, who they resented for no reason other than belief in Allah—the Almighty, the Praiseworthy—  ˹the One˺ to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and earth. And Allah is a Witness over all things. Those who persecute the believing men and women and then do not repent will certainly suffer the punishment of Hell and the torment of burning. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Said the Buddha to the slave girl, "Punna, you cannot go to sleep because you are poor and so

          <li>Man is born for uprightness. If a man lose his uprightness, and yet live, his escape from death is the
            effect of mere good fortune (C.A. quote 196)</li>
          <li>Did they have any repinings because of their course? They sought to act virtuously, and they did so;

            quote
            435) What is called a great minister, is one who serves his prince according to what is right, and when he

          <li>To give one's self earnestly to the duties due to men, and while respecting spiritual beings, to keep

And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.</li>
          <li>Genesis 3-22: But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</li>

And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</li>
          <li>Exodus 20-11, ..., 17: For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

And if you are in a state of ˹full˺ impurity,1 then take a full bath. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or have been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth by wiping your faces and hands.2 It is not Allah’s Will to burden you, but to purify you and complete His favour upon you, so perhaps you will be grateful. </li>

          <li>Quran 22-30: That is so. And whoever honours the rituals of Allah, it is best for them in the sight of their Lord. The ˹meat of˺ cattle has been made lawful for you, except what has ˹already˺ been recited to you.1 So shun the impurity of idolatry, and shun words of falsehood. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-78: Strive for ˹the cause of˺ Allah in the way He deserves, for ˹it is˺ He ˹Who˺ has chosen you, and laid upon you no hardship in the religion—the way of your forefather Abraham. ˹It is Allah˺ Who named you ‘the ones who submit’1 ˹in the˺ earlier ˹Scriptures˺ and in this ˹Quran˺, so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over humanity. So establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and hold fast to Allah. He ˹alone˺ is your Guardian. What an excellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper! </li>
          <li>Quran 24-54: Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then he is only responsible for his duty1 and you are responsible for yours.2 And if you obey him, you will be ˹rightly˺ guided. The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.” </li>
          <li>Quran 24-56: Moreover, establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and obey the Messenger, so you may be shown mercy. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-47: Indeed, We sent before you ˹O Prophet˺ messengers, each to their own people, and they came to them with clear proofs. Then We inflicted punishment upon those who persisted in wickedness. For it is Our duty to help the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-41, 42: O believers! Always remember Allah often, and glorify Him morning and evening.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-70: O believers! Be mindful of Allah, and say what is right.</li>
          <li>Quran 35-29, 30: Surely those who recite the Book of Allah, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—˹can˺ hope for an exchange that will never fail, so that He will reward them in full and increase them out of His grace. He is truly All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative.</li>
          <li>Quran 47-38: Here you are, being invited to donate ˹a little˺ in the cause of Allah. Still some of you withhold. And whoever does so, it is only to their own loss. For Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you stand in need ˹of Him˺. If you ˹still˺ turn away, He will replace you with another people. And they will not be like you. </li>
          <li>Quran 49-1: O believers! Do not proceed ˹in any matter˺ before ˹a decree from˺ Allah and His Messenger. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 61-11: ˹It is to˺ have faith in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if only you knew. </li>
          <li>Quran 62-9: O believers! When the call to prayer is made on Friday, then proceed ˹diligently˺ to the remembrance of Allah and leave off ˹your˺ business. That is best for you, if only you knew. </li>
          <li>Quran 62-10: Once the prayer is over, disperse throughout the land and seek the bounty of Allah. And remember Allah often so you may be successful. </li>
          <li>Quran 75-18, 19:  So once We have recited a revelation ˹through Gabriel˺, follow its recitation ˹closely˺. Then it is surely upon Us to make it clear ˹to you˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 79-45: Your duty is only to warn whoever is in awe of it. </li>
          <li>Quran 88-21: So, ˹continue to˺ remind ˹all, O  Prophet˺, for your duty is only to remind. </li>

            interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu."
            (C.A. quote 690) Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here? (C.A. 691) Now, in regard to
            Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang;
            moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct
            connection
            with the sovereign; What has your chief to do with attacking it?" (C.A. quote 692) Zan Yu said, "Our
            master
            wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it." (C.A. quote 693) Confucius said, "Ch'iu, there
            are
            the words of Chau Zan, -'When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office;
            when
            he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who
            does
            not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' (C.A. quote 694) "And further, you speak
            wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in
            its repository:-whose is the fault?" (C.A. quote 695) Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and
            near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants." (C.A.

          <li>The Story of Sundari the Wandering Female Ascetic: The king then ordered them to go round the town and
            confess their guilt to the people. So they went round the town saying, "We are the ones who killed Sundari.
            We have falsely accused the disciples of Gotama just to bring disgrace on Gotama. The disciples of Gotama

            and

          <li>Tsze-chang asked Confucius saying, "In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may
            conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the
            four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang said, "What are meant by the five
            excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without the great
            expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining (feel or express discontent; fret);
            when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being
            proud; when he is majestic without being fierce." (C.A. quote 846) Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by
            being
            beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more
            beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent
            without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who
            will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of
            covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not
            dare
            to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his
            clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with
            awe;-is
            not this to be majestic without being fierce?" (C.A. quote 848)</li>
          <li>Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, "What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the
            good of the principled?" Confucius replied, "Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use
            killing
            at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be good. The relation between
            superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind
            blows across it." (C.A. quote 489)</li>

And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.

And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.</li>

And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</li>
          <li>Exodus 4-27, ..., 31: And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</li>
          <li>Exodus 10-24, 25, 26: And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</li>
          <li>Exodus 15-13, ..., 17: Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.</li>
          <li>Exodus 16-29, 30: See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day.</li>
          <li>Exodus 17-13, ..., 16: And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</li>
          <li>Exodus 24-4: And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</li>
          <li>Exodus 24-7: And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.</li>
          <li>Exodus 24-14: And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.</li>
          <li>Exodus 28-3: And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.</li>
          <li>Exodus 28-29: And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.</li>
          <li>Exodus 8-6, 7: And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.</li>
          <li>Levitcus 15-31, 32, 33: Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them. This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.</li>

            Quran 1-4: Master of the Day of Judgment.
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-54: And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Surely you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf, so turn in repentance to your Creator and execute ˹the calf-worshippers among˺ yourselves. That is best for you in the sight of your Creator.” Then He accepted your repentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-124: ˹Remember˺ when Abraham was tested by his Lord with ˹certain˺ commandments, which he fulfilled. Allah said, “I will certainly make you into a role model for the people.” Abraham asked, “What about my offspring?” Allah replied, “My covenant is not extended to the wrongdoers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-193: Fight against them if they persecute you until there is no more persecution, and your devotion will be to Allah alone. If they stop persecuting you, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-213: Humanity had once been one community ˹of believers before they lost faith˺. Then Allah raised prophets as deliverers of good news and as warners, and revealed to them the Scriptures in truth to judge among people regarding their disputes. And no one disputed the Scriptures except the very people who received them after clear proofs had come to them—out of jealousy. Then Allah, by His grace, has guided the believers to the truth regarding those disputes. And Allah guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-225: Allah will not hold you accountable for unintentional oaths, but for what you intended in your hearts. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-282: O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.1 The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing ˹contracts˺ for a fixed period—whether the sum is small or great. This is more just ˹for you˺ in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded ˹your limits˺. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah ˹is the One Who˺ teaches you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-159: It is out of Allah’s mercy that you ˹O Prophet˺ have been lenient with them. Had you been cruel or hard-hearted, they would have certainly abandoned you. So pardon them, ask Allah’s forgiveness for them, and consult with them in ˹conducting˺ matters. Once you make a decision, put your trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves those who trust in Him. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-195: So their Lord responded to them: “I will never deny any of you—male or female—the reward of your deeds. Both are equal in reward. Those who migrated or were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted for My sake and fought and ˹some˺ were martyred—I will certainly forgive their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a reward from Allah. And with Allah is the finest reward!” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-2: Give orphans their wealth ˹when they reach maturity˺, and do not exchange your worthless possessions for their valuables, nor cheat them by mixing their wealth with your own. For this would indeed be a great sin. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-5: Do not entrust the incapable ˹among your dependants˺ with your wealth which Allah has made a means of support for you—but feed and clothe them from it, and speak to them kindly. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-58: Indeed, Allah commands you to return trusts to their rightful owners;1 and when you judge between people, judge with fairness. What a noble commandment from Allah to you! Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-88: Why are you ˹believers˺ divided into two groups regarding the hypocrites while Allah allowed them to regress ˹to disbelief˺ because of their misdeeds? Do you wish to guide those left by Allah to stray? And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way. 
          <li>Quran 4-90: except those who are allies of a people you are bound with in a treaty or those wholeheartedly opposed to fighting either you or their own people. If Allah had willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. So if they refrain from fighting you and offer you peace, then Allah does not permit you to harm them. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-161: ˹All were˺ messengers delivering good news and warnings so humanity should have no excuse before Allah after ˹the coming of˺ the messengers. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-54: O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, Allah will replace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be humble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in the Way of Allah; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-107, 108: If they are found guilty ˹of false testimony˺, let the deceased’s two closest heirs affected by the bequest replace the witnesses and testify under oath ˹saying˺, “By Allah! Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have not transgressed. Otherwise, we would surely be wrongdoers.” In this way it is more likely that witnesses will give true testimony or else fear that their oaths could be refuted by those of the heirs. Be mindful of Allah and obey. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-52: ˹O Prophet!˺ Do not dismiss those ˹poor believers˺ who invoke their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure.1 You are not accountable for them whatsoever, nor are they accountable for you. So do not dismiss them, or you will be one of the wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-131: This ˹sending of the messengers˺ is because your Lord would never destroy a society for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware ˹of the truth˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-132: They will each be assigned ranks according to their deeds. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do. 
          <li>Quran 7-42: As for those who believe and do good—We never require of any soul more than what it can afford—it is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-43: We will remove whatever bitterness they had in their hearts.1 Rivers will flow under their feet. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah for guiding us to this. We would have never been guided if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had certainly come with the truth.” It will be announced to them, “This is Paradise awarded to you for what you used to do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-168: We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-174: This is how We make our signs clear, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-181: And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and establishes justice accordingly. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-8: to firmly establish the truth and wipe out falsehood—even to the dismay of the wicked. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-57: If you ever encounter them in battle, make a fearsome example of them, so perhaps those who would follow them may be deterred. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-58: Do not let those disbelievers1 think they are not within reach. They will have no escape. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-43: May Allah pardon you ˹O Prophet˺! Why did you give them permission ˹to stay behind˺ before those who told the truth were distinguished from those who were lying? </li>
          <li>Quran 9-73: O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination! </li>
          <li>Quran 9-115: Allah would never consider a people deviant after He has guided them, until He makes clear to them what they must avoid. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-47: And for every community there is a messenger. After their messenger has come,1 judgment is passed on them in all fairness, and they are not wronged. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-111: And surely your Lord will fully pay all for their deeds. He is certainly All-Aware of what they do. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-119: except those shown mercy by your Lord—and so He created them ˹to choose freely˺. And so the Word of your Lord will be fulfilled: “I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-7: The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.” You ˹O Prophet˺ are only a warner. And every people had a guide. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-51: As such, Allah will reward every soul for what it has committed. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-13: And ˹He subjected˺ for you whatever He has created on earth of varying colours.1 Surely in this is a sign for those who are mindful. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-64: We have revealed to you the Book only to clarify for them what they differed about, and as a guide and mercy for those who believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-97: Whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, We will surely bless them with a good life, and We will certainly reward them according to the best of their deeds. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-120:  Indeed, Abraham was a model of excellence: devoted to Allah, ˹perfectly˺ upright—not a polytheist—</li>
          <li>Quran 19-64: “We only descend by the command of your Lord. To Him belongs whatever is before us, and whatever is behind us, and everything in between. And your Lord is never forgetful. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-15: The Hour is sure to come. My Will is to keep it hidden, so that every soul may be rewarded according to their efforts.</li>
          <li>Quran 21-78, 79, 80: And ˹remember˺ when David and Solomon passed judgment regarding the crops ruined ˹at night˺ by someone’s sheep, and We were witness to their judgments. We guided ˹young˺ Solomon to a fairer settlement,1 and granted each of them wisdom and knowledge. We subjected the mountains as well as the birds to hymn ˹Our praises˺ along with David. It is We Who did ˹it all˺. We taught him the art of making body armour to protect you in battle. Will you then be grateful? </li>
          <li>Quran 21-109: If they turn away, then say, “I have warned you all equally. I do not know if what you are threatened with is near or far. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-33: Whenever they bring you an argument, We come to you with the right refutation and the best explanation. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-208, 209: We have never destroyed a society without warners  to remind ˹them˺, for We would never wrong ˹anyone˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-3: We certainly tested those before them. And ˹in this way˺ Allah will clearly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are liars. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-21: And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 32-21: We will certainly make them taste some of the minor torment ˹in this life˺ before the major torment ˹of the Hereafter˺, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-60: If the hypocrites, and those with sickness in their hearts, and rumour-mongers in Medina do not desist, We will certainly incite you ˹O Prophet˺ against them, and then they will not be your neighbours there any longer.</li>
          <li>Quran 34-48, 49:  Say, “Surely my Lord hurls the truth ˹against falsehood˺. ˹He is˺ the Knower of all unseen.” Say, “The truth has come, and falsehood will vanish, never to return.” </li>
          <li>Quran 38-26: ˹We instructed him:˺ “O David! We have surely made you an authority in the land, so judge between people with truth. And do not follow ˹your˺ desires or they will lead you astray from Allah’s Way. Surely those who go astray from Allah’s Way will suffer a severe punishment for neglecting the Day of Reckoning.” </li>
          <li>Quran 39-46: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O Allah—Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the seen and unseen! You will judge between Your servants regarding their differences.” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-19: Allah ˹even˺ knows the sly glances of the eyes and whatever the hearts conceal. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-78: We already sent messengers before you. We have told you the stories of some of them, while others We have not. It was not for any messenger to bring a sign without Allah’s permission. But when Allah’s decree comes, judgment will be passed with fairness, and the people of falsehood will then be in ˹total˺ loss. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-16: So We sent against them a furious wind,1 for ˹several˺ miserable days, to make them taste a humiliating punishment in this worldly life. But far more humiliating will be the punishment of the Hereafter. And they will not be helped. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-19: Allah is Ever Kind to His servants. He provides ˹abundantly˺ to whoever He wills. And He is the All-Powerful, Almighty. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-24: Or do they say, “He has fabricated a lie about Allah!”? ˹If you had,˺ Allah would have sealed your heart, if He willed. And Allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth by His Words. He certainly knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-27: Had Allah given abundant provisions to ˹all˺ His servants, they would have certainly transgressed throughout the land. But He sends down whatever He wills in perfect measure. He is truly All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants. </li>
          <li>Quran 44-28: So it was. And We awarded it ˹all˺ to another people.</li>
          <li>Quran 45-31: And as for those who disbelieved, ˹they will be told,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you, yet you acted arrogantly and were a wicked people? </li>
          <li>Quran 47-4: So when you meet the disbelievers ˹in battle˺, strike ˹their˺ necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later ˹free them either as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had Allah willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of Allah,1 He will never render their deeds void. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-6: Also ˹so that˺ He may punish hypocrite men and women and polytheistic men and women, who harbour evil thoughts of Allah.1 May ill-fate befall them! Allah is displeased with them. He has condemned them and prepared for them Hell. What an evil destination! </li>
          <li>Quran 49-9: And if two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between them. But if one of them transgresses against the other, then fight against the transgressing group until they ˹are willing to˺ submit to the rule of Allah. If they do so, then make peace between both ˹groups˺ in all fairness and act justly. Surely Allah loves those who uphold justice. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-54: So ˹now˺ turn away from them ˹O Prophet˺, for you will not be blamed.1</li>
          <li>Quran 51-55: But ˹continue to˺ remind. For certainly reminders benefit the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 52-48: So be patient with your Lord’s decree, for you are truly under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes. And glorify the praises of your Lord when you rise. </li>
          <li>Quran 55-10: He laid out the earth for all beings. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-3: Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have certainly punished them in this world. And in the Hereafter they will suffer the punishment of the Fire. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-7: As for gains granted by Allah to His Messenger from the people of ˹other˺ lands, they are for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers so that wealth may not merely circulate among your rich. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. And whatever he forbids you from, leave it. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-8: ˹Some of the gains will be˺ for poor emigrants who were driven out of their homes and wealth, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure, and standing up for Allah and His Messenger. They are the ones true in faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 60-12: O Prophet! When the believing women come to you, pledging to you that they will neither associate anything with Allah ˹in worship˺, nor steal, nor fornicate, nor kill their children, nor falsely attribute ˹illegitimate˺ children to their husbands,1 nor disobey you in what is right, then accept their pledge, and ask Allah to forgive them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 65-3: and provide for them from sources they could never imagine. And whoever puts their trust in Allah, then He ˹alone˺ is sufficient for them. Certainly Allah achieves His Will. Allah has already set a destiny for everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 66-7: Let the man of wealth provide according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him provide according to whatever Allah has given him. Allah does not require of any soul beyond what He has given it. After hardship, Allah will bring about ease. </li>
          <li>Quran 66-9: O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination! </li>
          <li>Quran 67-14: How could He not know His Own creation? For He ˹alone˺ is the Most Subtle, All-Aware. </li>
          <li>Quran 89-15: ˹For˺ your Lord is truly vigilant. </li>
          <li>Quran 98-1, ..., 5: The disbelievers from the People of the Book and the polytheists were not going to desist ˹from disbelief˺ until the clear proof came to them:  a messenger from Allah, reciting scrolls of ˹utmost˺ purity, containing upright commandments.  It was not until this clear proof came to the People of the Book that they became divided ˹about his prophethood˺— even though they were only commanded to worship Allah ˹alone˺ with sincere devotion to Him in all uprightness, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. That is the upright Way. </li>
          <li>Quran 106-1, ..., 4: ˹At least˺ for ˹the favour of˺ making Quraysh habitually secure— secure in their trading caravan ˹to Yemen˺ in the winter and ˹Syria˺ in the summer— let them worship the Lord of this ˹Sacred˺ House, Who has fed them against hunger and made them secure against fear.1  </li>

      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>The Story of Kukkutamitta: The bhikkhus then asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir, is the wife of the hunter
            who is a sotapanna, also not guilty of taking life, if she has been getting things like nets, bows and
            arrows for her husband when he goes out hunting?" To this question the Buddha answered, "Bhikkhus, the
            sotapannas do not kill, they do not wish others to get killed. The wife of the hunter was only obeying her
            husband in getting things for him. Just as the hand that has no wound is not affected by poison, so also,
            because she has no intention to do evil she is not doing any evil."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 124: If there is no wound on the hand, one may handle poison; poison does not affect one
            who has no wound; there can be no evil for one who has no evil intention. </li>
          <li>The Story of Koka the Huntsman: The Buddha said, "My son, rest assured and have no doubt; you are not
            responsible for the death of the hunter; your morality (sila) is also not soiled on account of that death.
            Indeed, that huntsman did a great wrong to one whom he should do no wrong and so had come to this grievous
            end."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 125: If one wrongs a person who should not be wronged, one who is pure and is free from
            moral defilements, viz., an arahat, the evil falls back upon that fool, like fine dust thrown against the
            wind. </li>
          <li>
            The Story of the Judge: They reported the matter to the Buddha and the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! In
            deciding cases, if one is influenced by affection or by monetary consideration, he cannot be called 'the
            just', or 'a judge who abides by the law.' If one weighs the evidence intelligently and decides a case
            impartially, then he is to be called, 'the just' or 'a judge who abides by the law.'"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 256: He is not just if he decides a case arbitrarily; the wise man should decide after
            considering both what is right and what is wrong.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Tsze-kung asked, saying, "What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people in his neighborhood?"
            The Master replied, "We may not for that accord our approval of him." "And what do you say of him who is
            hated by all the people of his neighborhood?" The Master said, "We may not for that conclude that he is
            bad.
            It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad hate him."

            feel at ease?" "I should," replied Wo. (C.A. quote 767) The Master said, "If you can feel at ease, do it.
            But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat,

            "Truly a good question!" (C.A. quote 497) "If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and
            success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail one's own wickedness and
            not assail that of others;-is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a morning's anger to

            one's own life, and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?" (C.A. quote 498)</li>

But if someone is compelled by necessity-neither driven by desire nor exceeding immdiate need-they will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-178: O believers! The law of retaliation is set for you in cases of murder-a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if the offender is pardoned by the victim's guardian, then blood-money should be decided fairly and payment should be made courteously. This is a concession and mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgreses after that will suffer a painful punishment.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-190: Fight in the cause of Allah only against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-191: Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing.

The child’s father will provide reasonable maintenance and clothing for the mother ˹during that period˺. No one will be charged with more than they can bear. No mother or father should be made to suffer for their child. The ˹father’s˺ heirs are under the same obligation. But if both sides decide—after mutual consultation and consent—to wean a child, then there is no blame on them. If you decide to have your children nursed by a wet-nurse, it is permissible as long as you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>

          <li>Quran 4-25: But if any of you cannot afford to marry a free believing woman, then ˹let him marry˺ a believing bondwoman possessed by one of you. Allah knows best ˹the state of˺ your faith ˹and theirs˺. You are from one another.1 So marry them with the permission of their owners,2 giving them their dowry in fairness, if they are chaste, neither promiscuous nor having secret affairs. If they commit indecency after marriage, they receive half the punishment of free women.3 This is for those of you who fear falling into sin. But if you are patient, it is better for you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li> 
          <li>Quran 4-34: Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially.

And whoever kills a believer unintentionally must free a believing slave and pay blood-money to the victim’s family—unless they waive it charitably. But if the victim is a believer from a hostile people, then a believing slave must be freed. And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months—as a means of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-95: O  believers! Do not kill game while on pilgrimage. Whoever kills game intentionally must compensate by offering its equivalence—as judged by two just men among you—to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting so that they may taste the consequences of their violations. Allah has forgiven what has been done. But those who persist will be punished by Allah. And Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment. </li>

          <li>Quran 9-85: And let neither their wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this world, and ˹then˺ their souls will depart while they are disbelievers. </li>

          <li>Quran 22-39: Permission ˹to fight back˺ is ˹hereby˺ granted to those being fought, for they have been wronged.1 And Allah is truly Most Capable of helping them ˹prevail˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-62: We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. And with Us is a record which speaks the truth. None will be wronged. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-11:  Indeed, those who came up with that ˹outrageous˺ slander are a group of you. Do not think this is bad for you.

          <li>Quran 33-5: Let your adopted children keep their family names. That is more just in the sight of Allah. But if you do not know their fathers, then they are ˹simply˺ your fellow believers and close associates. There is no blame on you for what you do by mistake, but ˹only˺ for what you do intentionally. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-49: O believers! If you marry believing women and then divorce them before you touch them,1 they will have no waiting period for you to count,2 so give them a ˹suitable˺ compensation, and let them go graciously.</li>

          <li>Quran 48-10: Surely those who pledge allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. Allah’s Hand is over theirs. Whoever breaks their pledge, it will only be to their own loss. And whoever fulfils their pledge to Allah, He will grant them a great reward. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-17: There is no blame on the blind, or the disabled, or the sick ˹for staying behind˺. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers flow. But whoever turns away will be subjected by Him to a painful punishment. </li>

Judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of those who judge.” </li>
          <li>Quran 12-111: In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather ˹it is˺ a confirmation of previous revelation, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-123: Then We revealed to you ˹O Prophet, saying˺: “Follow the faith of Abraham, the upright, who was not one of the polytheists.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-77: ˹This has been˺ Our way with the messengers We sent before you. And you will never find any change in Our way. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-95: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Had there been angels walking the earth, well settled, We would have surely sent down for them an angel from heaven as a messenger.” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-133: They demand, “If only he could bring us a sign from his Lord!”1 Have they not ˹already˺ received a confirmation of what is in earlier Scriptures?2 </li>
          <li>Quran 33-62: That was Allah’s way with those ˹hypocrites˺ who have gone before. And you will find no change in Allah’s way.</li>
          <li>Quran 35-31: The Book We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, confirming what came before it.1 Surely Allah is All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants. </li>
          <li>Quran 37-37: In fact, he came with the truth, confirming ˹earlier˺ messengers. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-12: And before this ˹Quran˺ the Book of Moses was ˹revealed as˺ a guide and mercy. And this Book is a confirmation, in the Arabic tongue, to warn those who do wrong, and as good news to those who do good. </li>
          <li>Quran 73-15: Indeed, We have sent to you a messenger as a witness over you, just as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh. </li>
          <li>Quran 76-11: So Allah will deliver them from the horror of that Day, and grant them radiance and joy, and reward them for their perseverance with a Garden ˹in Paradise˺ and ˹garments of˺ silk. </li>
          <li>Quran 87-18, 19: This is certainly ˹mentioned˺ in the earlier Scriptures—  the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses. </li>

          <li>The Bhikkhus Who Lived on the Bank of the Vaggumuda River: The Buddha knew how those bhikkhus had managed
            to get enough alms-food. But he wanted to teach them on this point, so he asked, "How did you manage so well
            in getting alms-food throughout the vassa ?"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 353: I have overcome all, I know all, I am detached from all, I have given up all; I am
            liberated from moral defilements having eradicated craving, (i.e., I have attained arahatship). Having
            comprehended the Four Noble Truths by myself, whom should I point out as my teacher? </li>
          <li>The Story of Thirty Bhikkhus: The Venerable Sariputta, seeing that time was ripe and proper for those
            bhikkhus to attain arahatship, approached the Buddha and asked a question, solely for the benefit of those
            bhikkhus. The question was this: "What are the two dhammas?" To this the Buddha replied, "Sariputta!
            Tranquillity and Insight Meditation are the two dhammas."</li>

            If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of
            others (C.A. quote 48) </li>
          <li>Let me return! Let me return! The little children of my school are ambitious and too hasty. They are

          <li>I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not

          <li>Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, "I looked up to them, and they
            seemed

          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: The Buddha was satisfied with the explanation given by the Venerable
            Sariputta and said to the other bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus! The Venerable Sariputta was not worshipping the various
            directions; he was only paying obeisance to his teacher and benefactor, through whom he had attained the
            Deathless. It is quite right and proper for him to pay homage to such a teacher."</li>

            Genesis 37-32, ..., 35: And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
          </li>
          <li>Genesis 42-7, ..., 22: And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. And he put them all together into ward three days. And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</li>
          <li>Genesis 42-24, ..., 38: And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
          <li>Exodus 13-14: And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:</li>
          <li>Exodus 21-31: Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.</li>
          <li>Exodus 36-2, 3: And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.</li>

            Quran 2-145: Even if you were to bring every proof to the People of the Book, they would not accept your direction ˹of prayer˺, nor would you accept theirs; nor would any of them accept the direction ˹of prayer˺ of another.

          <li>Quran 4-45: Allah knows best who your enemies are! And Allah is sufficient as a Guardian, and He is sufficient as a Helper. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-63: Why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and consuming what is unlawful? Evil indeed is their inaction! </li>
          <li>Quran 11-1: Alif-Lãm-Ra. ˹This is˺ a Book whose verses are well perfected and then fully explained. ˹It is˺ from the One ˹Who is˺ All-Wise, All-Aware. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92: They appealed, “O Chief Minister! He has a very old father, so take one of us instead. We surely see you as one of the good-doers.” Joseph responded, “Allah forbid that we should take other than the one with whom we found our property. Otherwise, we would surely be unjust.” When they lost all hope in him, they spoke privately. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father had taken a solemn oath by Allah from you, nor how you failed him regarding Joseph before? So I am not leaving this land until my father allows me to, or Allah decides for me. For He is the Best of Judges. Return to your father and say, ‘O our father! Your son committed theft. We testify only to what we know. We could not guard against the unforeseen.1 Ask ˹the people of˺ the land where we were and the caravan we travelled with. We are certainly telling the truth.’”  He cried, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something ˹evil˺. So ˹I am left with nothing but˺ beautiful patience!1 I trust Allah will return them all to me. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.” He turned away from them, lamenting, “Alas, poor Joseph!” And his eyes turned white out of the grief he suppressed.1 They said, “By Allah! You will not cease to remember Joseph until you lose your health or ˹even˺ your life.” He replied, “I complain of my anguish and sorrow only to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know. O  my sons! Go and search ˹diligently˺ for Joseph and his brother. And do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah, for no one loses hope in Allah’s mercy except those with no faith.” When they entered Joseph’s presence, they pleaded, “O Chief Minister! We and our family have been touched with hardship, and we have brought only a few worthless coins, but ˹please˺ give us our supplies in full and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.” He asked, “Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?” Joseph said, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most Merciful of the merciful!</li>
          <li>Quran 12-100: Then he raised his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration to Joseph,1 who then said, “O my dear father! This is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was truly kind to me when He freed me from prison, and brought you all from the desert after Satan had ignited rivalry between me and my siblings.2 Indeed my Lord is subtle in fulfilling what He wills. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-16: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “Allah!” Ask ˹them˺, “Why ˹then˺ have you taken besides Him lords who cannot even benefit or protect themselves?” Say, “Can the blind and the sighted be equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?”1 Or have they associated with Allah partners who ˹supposedly˺ produced a creation like His, leaving them confused between the two creations? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-106: ˹It is˺ a Quran We have revealed in stages so that you may recite it to people at a deliberate pace. And We have sent it down in successive revelations. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-53: All that so He may make Satan’s influence a trial for those ˹hypocrites˺ whose hearts are sick and those ˹disbelievers˺ whose hearts are hardened. Surely the wrongdoers are totally engrossed in opposition. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-18:  And Allah makes ˹His˺ commandments clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-39: For each We set forth ˹various˺ lessons, and We ultimately destroyed each. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-76:  Indeed, this Quran clarifies for the Children of Israel most of what they differ over. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-20: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Travel throughout the land and see how He originated the creation, then Allah will bring it into being one more time. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-41: Corruption has spread on land and sea as a result of what people’s hands have done, so that Allah may cause them to taste ˹the consequences of˺ some of their deeds and perhaps they might return ˹to the Right Path˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-7: But no prophet ever came to them without being mocked. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-6: These are Allah’s revelations which We recite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. So what message will they believe in after ˹denying˺ Allah and His revelations? </li>
          <li>Quran 46-10: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Consider if this ˹Quran˺ is ˹truly˺ from Allah and you deny it, and a witness from the Children of Israel attests to it and then believes,1 whereas you act arrogantly. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.” </li>
          <li>Quran 57-9: He is the One Who sends down clear revelations to His servant to bring you out of darkness and into light. For indeed Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to you. </li>
          <li>Quran 61-9: He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹true˺ guidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others, even to the dismay of the polytheists. </li>
          <li>Quran 71-8, ..., 14: Then I certainly called them openly, then I surely preached to them publicly and privately, saying, ‘Seek your Lord’s forgiveness, ˹for˺ He is truly Most Forgiving.

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 5: Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by
            loving-kindness. This is an ancient law.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 227: It is not new, O Atula! It has always been done from ancient times. They blame one
            who is silent, they blame one who speaks much, they blame one who speaks little. There is no one in this
            world who is not blamed.
            Verse 228: There never has been, there never will be, nor is there now, anyone who is always blamed or
            always praised.
            Verses 229 - 230: If the wise praise him day after day, knowing him to be truly faultless, wise and endowed
            with knowledge and virtue, who would blame him, who is like a nikkha of pure gold? The devas praise him; he
            is praised even by the great Brahmas.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest
            their
            actions should not come up to them (C.A. quote 128)</li>
          <li>A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with
            our
            old P'ang (C.A. quote 210)</li>
          <li>In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to
            the
            approbation of others." (C.A. qute 598)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang said, "What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial
            mourning, was for three years without speaking?" (C.A. quote 625) The Master said, "Why must Kao-tsung be
            referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all
            attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years." (C.A.
            quote
            626) The Master said, "When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to
            the
            calls on them for service." (C.A. quote 627)</li>
          <li>Anciently, men had three failings, which now perhaps are not to be found. (C.A. quote 757) The
            high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the
            present day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve;
            the
            stern dignity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. The stupidity of antiquity
            showed
            itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity of the present day shows itself in sheer deceit." (C.A. quote

          <li>Quran 10-79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90: Pharaoh demanded, “Bring me every skilled magician.” When the magicians came, Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you wish to cast!” And Allah establishes the truth by His Words—even to the dismay of the wicked.” But no one believed in Moses except a few youths of his people, while fearing that Pharaoh and their own chiefs might persecute them. And certainly Pharaoh was a tyrant in the land, and he was truly a transgressor.  Moses said, “O my people! If you do believe in Allah and submit ˹to His Will˺, then put your trust in Him. They replied, “In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Do not subject us to the persecution of the oppressive people, and deliver us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.” We revealed to Moses and his brother, “Appoint houses for your people in Egypt. Turn these houses into places of worship, establish prayer, and give good news to the believers!” Moses prayed, “Our Lord! You have granted Pharaoh and his chiefs luxuries and riches in this worldly life, ˹which they abused˺ to lead people astray from Your Way! Our Lord, destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.” Allah responded ˹to Moses and Aaron˺,1 “Your prayer is answered! So be steadfast and do not follow the way of those who do not know.” We brought the Children of Israel across the sea. Then Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them unjustly and oppressively. But as Pharaoh was drowning, he cried out, “I believe that there is no god except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am ˹now˺ one of those who submit.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-101, 102, 103, 104: We surely gave Moses nine clear signs.1 ˹You, O  Prophet, can˺ ask the Children of Israel. When Moses came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “I really think that you, O  Moses, are bewitched.” Moses replied, “You know well that none has sent these ˹signs˺ down except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as insights. And I really think that you, O  Pharaoh, are doomed.” So Pharaoh wanted to scare the Israelites out of the land ˹of Egypt˺, but We drowned him and all of those with him. And We said to the Children of Israel after Pharaoh, “Reside in the land, but when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass,1 We will bring you all together.” </li>

          <li>Quran 22-33, 34: You may benefit from sacrificial animals for an appointed term,1 then their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House. For every community We appointed a rite of sacrifice so that they may pronounce the Name of Allah over the sacrificial animals He has provided for them. For your God is only One God, so submit yourselves to Him ˹alone˺. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the humble: </li>

          <li>The Story of Three Ascetics: Other bhikkhus reported their behaviour to the Buddha and he called them to
            his presence, and said to them, "Once you have joined the Order, you should no longer stay together like a
            family. Not seeing those who are dear, and seeing those who are not dear to one, are both painful; so you
            should not hold any being or anything dear to you</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 212: Affection begets sorrow, affection begets fear. For him who is free from affection
            there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? /li>
          <li>The Story of Mara: But Rahula was unmoved. The Buddha, from his chamber, knew what was happening, and
            said, "O wicked Mara! Even a thousand such as you would not be able to frighten my son. My son has no fear,

          <li>Genesis 48-1, ..., 14: And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</li>

Certainly my son is ˹also˺ of my family, Your promise is surely true, and You are the most just of all judges!” Allah replied, “O Noah! He is certainly not of your family—he was entirely of unrighteous conduct. So do not ask Me about what you have no knowledge of!

When pilgrimage has ended, you are allowed to hunt. Do not let the hatred of a people who once barred you from the Sacred Mosque provoke you to transgress.

          <li>Quran 29-46: Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. And say, “We believe in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to you. Our God and your God is ˹only˺ One. And to Him we ˹fully˺ submit.”</li>
          <li>Quran 31-19: Be moderate in your pace. And lower your voice, for the ugliest of all voices is certainly the braying of donkeys.” </li>
          <li>Quran 49-2: O believers! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak loudly to him as you do to one another,1 or your deeds will become void while you are unaware. </li>
          <li>Quran 49-4: Indeed, most of those who call out to you ˹O Prophet˺ from outside ˹your˺ private quarters have no understanding ˹of manners˺.1</li>
          <li>Quran 58-11: O believers! When you are told to make room in gatherings, then do so. Allah will make room for you ˹in His grace˺. And if you are told to rise, then do so. Allah will elevate those of you who are faithful, and ˹raise˺ those gifted with knowledge in rank. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 60-8: Allah does not forbid you from dealing kindly and fairly with those who have neither fought nor driven you out of your homes. Surely Allah loves those who are fair. </li>

          <li>The Story of Theri Patacara: The Buddha said to her, "Patacara, have no fear; you have now come to one who
            can protect you and guide you. Throughout this round of existences (samsara), the amount of tears you have
            shed on account of the death of your sons, husbands, parents and brothers is voluminous; it is even more
            than the waters of the four oceans."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 309: Four misfortunes befall a man who is unmindful of right conduct and commit sexual
            misconduct with another man's wife: acquisition of demerit, disturbed sleep, reproach, and suffering in
            niraya.
            Verse 310: Thus, there is the acquisition of demerit, and there is rebirth in the evil apaya realms. The
            enjoyment of a scared man with a scared woman is short-lived, and the king also metes out severe punishment.
            Therefore, a man should not commit misconduct with another man's wife.</li>

And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

          <li>Quran 2-187: It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives during the nights preceding the fast. Your spouses are a garment for you as you are for them. Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves. So He has accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may be intimate with them and seek what Allah has prescribed for you. You may eat and drink until you see the light of dawn breaking the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. Do not be intimate with your spouses while you are meditating in the mosques. These are limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to people, so they may become mindful of Him.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-240: Those of you who die leaving widows should bequeath for them a year’s maintenance without forcing them out.1 But if they choose to leave, you are not accountable for what they reasonably decide for themselves. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-129: You will never be able to maintain ˹emotional˺ justice between your wives—no matter how keen you are. So do not totally incline towards one leaving the other in suspense.1 And if you do what is right and are mindful ˹of Allah˺, surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-28: And know that your wealth and your children are only a test and that with Allah is a great reward.</li>
          <li>Quran 18-22: That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour.1 When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth ˹after their death˺,2 some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.” </li>
          <li>Quran 18-23: And never say of anything, “I will definitely do this tomorrow,” without adding, “if Allah so wills!” But if you forget, then remember your Lord, and say, “I trust my Lord will guide me to what is more right than this.” </li>
          <li>Quran 24-6, 7, 8 9: And those who accuse their wives ˹of adultery˺ but have no witness except themselves, the accuser must testify,1 swearing four times by Allah that he is telling the truth, and a fifth oath that Allah may condemn him if he is lying.  For her to be spared the punishment, she must swear four times by Allah that he is telling a lie, and a fifth oath that Allah may be displeased with her if he is telling the truth.1</li>
          <li>Quran 33-28: O Prophet! Say to your wives, “If you desire the life of this world and its luxury, then come, I will give you a ˹suitable˺ compensation ˹for divorce˺ and let you go graciously.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-37: And ˹remember, O  Prophet,˺ when you said to the one1 for whom Allah has done a favour and you ˹too˺ have done a favour,2 “Keep your wife and fear Allah,” while concealing within yourself what Allah was going to reveal. And ˹so˺ you were considering the people, whereas Allah was more worthy of your consideration. So when Zaid totally lost interest in ˹keeping˺ his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no blame on the believers for marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons after their divorce. And Allah’s command is totally binding.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-51: It is up to you ˹O Prophet˺ to delay or receive whoever you please of your wives. There is no blame on you if you call back any of those you have set aside.1 That is more likely that they will be content, not grieved, and satisfied with what you offer them all. Allah ˹fully˺ knows what is in your hearts. And Allah is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-52: It is not lawful for you ˹O Prophet˺ to marry more women after this, nor can you replace any of your present wives with another, even if her beauty may attract you—except those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession. And Allah is ever Watchful over all things.</li>
          <li>Quran 58-3: Those who divorce their wives in this manner, then ˹wish to˺ retract what they said, must free a slave before they touch each other. This ˹penalty˺ is meant to deter you. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 58-4: But if the husband cannot afford this, let him then fast two consecutive months before the couple touch each other. But if he is unable ˹to fast˺, then let him feed sixty poor people. This is to re-affirm your faith in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits set by Allah. And the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 66-1: O Prophet! Why do you prohibit ˹yourself˺ from what Allah has made lawful to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>

And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

          <li>Quran 24-31: And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, and not to reveal their adornments1 except what normally appears.2 Let them draw their veils over their chests, and not reveal their ˹hidden˺ adornments3 except to their husbands, their fathers, their fathers-in-law, their sons, their stepsons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons or sisters’ sons, their fellow women, those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, male attendants with no desire, or children who are still unaware of women’s nakedness. Let them not stomp their feet, drawing attention to their hidden adornments. Turn to Allah in repentance all together, O  believers, so that you may be successful. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-60: As for elderly women past the age of marriage, there is no blame on them if they take off their ˹outer˺ garments, without revealing their adornments. But it is better for them if they avoid this ˹altogether˺. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-59: O Prophet! Ask your wives, daughters, and believing women to draw their cloaks over their bodies. In this way it is more likely that they will be recognized ˹as virtuous˺ and not be harassed. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.1 </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 37: The mind wanders far and moves about alone: it is non-material; it lies in the cave
            (chamber) of the heart. Those who control their mind will be free from the bonds of Mara.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 40: Knowing that this body is (fragile) like an earthern jar, making one's mind secure
            like a fortified town, one should fight Mara with the weapon of Knowledge. (After defeating Mara) one
            should
            still continue to guard one's mind, and feel no attachment to that which has been gained (i.e., jhana
            ecstasy and serenity gained through meditation).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 27: Therefore, one should not be negligent, nor be addicted to sensual pleasures; for
            he
            who is established in mindfulness, through cultivation of Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice,
            experiences supreme happiness (i.e., realizes Nibbana)./li>

          <li>The Story of a Woman: The Buddha saw him from his monastery, and with his supernormal power, sent rays of
            light to him, and the bhikkhu received this message, which said, "My son, where worldlings seek sensual
            pleasures is not the place for bhikkhus; bhikkhus should take delight in forests where worldlings find no
            pleasure."</li>
          <li>The Story of Khanu-Kondanna: "To live for a hundred years in ignorance, doing foolish things, is useless;
            now that you have seen the Truth and have become wise, your life of one day as a wise man is much more
            worthwhile.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Pilotikatissa: But the Buddha refuted them, and said, "Bhikkhus! Pilotikatissa is not
            telling lies, he speaks the truth. Though he had relationship with his teacher previously, now he has no
            relationship whatsoever with his teacher. Thera Pilotikatissa has instructed himself to differentiate right
            and wrong causes and to discern the true nature of things. He has now become an arahat, and so there is no
            further connection between him and his teacher."</li>

            waste away in dejection like decrepit herons on a drying pond deplete of fish.
            Verse 156: They, who in youth have neither led the Life of Purity nor have acquired wealth, lie helplessly

            one to prolong samsara (lit., the world).</li>
          <li>
            The Story of a Young Bhikkhu: The Buddha knew that the bhikkhu was then in a receptive mood and so he said,
            "To smile
            with sensual desire is ignoble; it is not right and proper to have ignoble thoughts."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 167: Do not follow ignoble ways, do not live in negligence, do not embrace wrong views,
            do not be the one to prolong samsara (lit., the world). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 206: It is good to see the Noble Ones (ariyas); to live with them is always a pleasure;
            not seeing fools is also always a pleasure.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Man Whose Wife Committed Adultery: On learning the reason for his absence, the Buddha said,
            "My disciple, women are just like a river, or a road, or a liquor shop or a rest house, or a water-pot stand
            at the roadside; they associate with all sorts of people. Indeed, sexual misconduct is the cause of ruin for
            a woman."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 280: The idler who does not strive when he should be striving, who though young and
            strong is given to idleness, whose thoughts are weak and wandering, will not attain Magga Insight which can
            only be perceived by wisdom. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa the Idle One: On hearing about the above incident the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, one
            who does not strive when he should be striving but idle away his time will not attain mental absorption
            (jhana) and Magga Insight."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 281: One should be careful in speech, be well-restrained in mind, and physically, too,
            one should do no evil. One should purify these three courses of action and accomplish the practice of the
            Path of Eight Constituents made known by the Buddhas. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 332: In this world it is good to be dutiful to one's mother; also it is good to be
            dutiful to one's father. In this world it is good to minister unto samanas1; also it is good to minister
            unto brahmanas2.</li>
          <li>The Story of Culadhanuggaha, the Skilful Archer: The Buddha called the young bhikkhu to his presence and
            said to him, "My son, listen to me. This young woman will be your undoing just as she had been to you in a
            previous existence. In one of your previous existences you were a very skilful archer and she was your wife.
            On one occasion, while the two of you were travelling, you came upon a gang of highwaymen. She fell in love
            with the gang leader. So, while you and the gang leader were engaged in fighting and you called out to her
            to give you the sword, she gave the sword to the robber who promptly killed you. Thus, she was the cause of
            your death. Now, too, she will be the cause of your ruin if you go after her and leave my Order for her
            sake."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 371: O Bhikkhu, mediate, and do not be unmindful; do not let your mind rejoice in sensual
            pleasures. Do not be unmindful and swallow the (hot) lump of iron; as you burn (in niraya) do not cry,
            "This, indeed, is suffering."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 382: A bhikkhu who, though young, devotes himself to the Teaching of the Buddha lights up
            the world, as does the moon freed from a cloud.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 383: O Brahmana, cut off the stream of craving with diligence, and abandon sense desires.

          <li>Tsze-chang asked Confucius about perfect virtue. Confucius said, "To be able to practice five things
            everywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue." He begged to ask what they were, and was told,
            "Gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you are grave, you will not be
            treated with disrespect. If you are generous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose (a
            state of rest, sleep, or tranquility) trust in you. If you are earnest, you will accomplish much. If you
            are
            kind, this will enable you to employ the services of others. (C.A. quote 735) </li>

Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.” So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep1 in the cave for many years, then We raised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better estimation of the length of their stay.1  We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.  And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.”  And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.” ˹Then they said to one another,˺ “These people of ours have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah? Since you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship besides Allah, take refuge in the cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and accommodate you in your ordeal.” And you would have seen the sun, as it rose, inclining away from their cave to the right, and as it set, declining away from them to the left, while they lay in its open space.1 That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor. And you would have thought they were awake,1 though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked at them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror. That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour.1 When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth ˹after their death˺,2 some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.”  They had remained in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine.1</li>

But if they disobey you, say, “I am certainly free of what you do.”  Put your trust in the Almighty, Most Merciful,  Who sees you when you rise ˹for prayer at night˺,  as well as your movements ˹in prayer˺ along with ˹fellow˺ worshippers. </li>

Do not let them turn you away from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down to you. Rather, invite ˹all˺ to ˹the Way of˺ your Lord, and never be one of the polytheists. And do not invoke any other god with Allah. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. Everything is bound to perish except He Himself.1 All authority belongs to Him. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-60:  So be patient, for the promise of Allah certainly is true. And do not be disturbed by those who have no sure faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-18: “And do not turn your nose up to people, nor walk pridefully upon the earth. Surely Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-1:  O Prophet! ˹Always˺ be mindful of Allah, and do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>

          <li>Quran 49-12: O  believers! Avoid many suspicions, ˹for˺ indeed, some suspicions are sinful. And do not spy, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of their dead brother? You would despise that!1 And fear Allah. Surely Allah is ˹the˺ Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-51: And do not set up another god with Allah. I am truly sent by Him with a clear warning to you.” </li>

          <li>Quran 58-9: O believers! When you converse privately, let it not be for sin, aggression, or disobedience to the Messenger, but let it be for goodness and righteousness. And fear Allah, to Whom you will ˹all˺ be gathered. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-4: This is because they defied Allah and His Messenger. And whoever defies Allah, then Allah is truly severe in punishment. </li>

          <li>The Story of the Boa Constrictor Peta: The Buddha also said he himself had also seen that very peta soon
            after he had attained Buddhahood, but that he did not say anything about it because people might not believe
            him and thus they would be doing a great wrong to the Buddha. So out of compassion for these beings, the
            Buddha had kept silent. Then he continued, "Now that I have a witness in Moggallana, I will tell you about
            this boa constrictor peta. This peta was a thief during the time of Kassapa Buddha. As a thief and a
            cruel-hearted man, he had set fire to the house of a rich man seven times. And not satisfied with that, he
            also set fire to the perfumed hall donated by the same rich man to Kassapa Buddha, while Kassapa Buddha was
            out on an alms-round. As a result of those evil deeds he had suffered for a long time in niraya. Now, while
            serving out his term of suffering as a peta, he is being burnt with sparks of flames going up and down the
            length of his body. Bhikkhus, fools when doing evil deeds do not know them as being evil; but they cannot
            escape the evil consequences"</li>

          <li>The Story of an Ex-Bhikkhu: The Venerable Mahakassapa saw his pupil as he was being led out and said to
            him, "My pupil, keep your mind steadfastly on a subject of meditation." As instructed, he concentrated and
            let himself be established in deep mental absorption. At the cemetery, while the executioners were making
            preparations to kill him, the ex-bhikkhu was very much composed and showed no signs of fear or anxiety. The
            executioners and the onlookers were awe-struck and very much impressed by the man's courage and composure
            and they reported about him to the king and also to the Buddha.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 347: Beings who are infatuated with lust, fall back into the Stream of Craving they have

            of
            full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he
            would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily (C.A. quote 307)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, "There
            are
            your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately
            carrying
            into practice what you hear?" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice
            what
            he heard, and the Master answered, "Immediately carry into practice what you hear." Kung-hsi Hwa said, "Yu
            asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and Yu said, 'There are your father
            and elder brothers to be consulted.' Chi'u asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he
            heard, and Yu said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Chi'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you
            for an explanation." The Master said, "Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has
            more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back."</li>

          <li>The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu, Ching-po informed Confucius of it,
            saying,
            "Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut
            Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court." (C.A. quote 617) The Master said, "If my
            principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can
            the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?" (C.A. quote 618) The Master said, "Some men of
            worth
            retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks.
            Some
            retire because of contradictory language." (C.A. quote 619) The Master said, "Those who have done this are
            seven men." (C.A. quote 620)</li>

          <li>Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was
            like
            an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When
            good
            government prevails in his state, his is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll
            his principles up, and keep them in his breast." (C.A. quote 644)</li>
          <li>When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not
            be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to
            their
            man nor to their words (C.A. quote 645)</li>

          <li>A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his
            vistors. Some one asked about him, saying, "I suppose he has made great progress." (C.A. quote 630) The
            Master said, "I observe that he fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks
            shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes
            quickly to become a man." (C.A. quote 631)</li>

          <li>Tsze-lu said, "Does the superior man esteem valor?" The Master said, "The superior man holds
            righteousness
            to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be
            guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without righteousness, will commit

And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
          </li>
          <li>Genesis 24-49, 50: And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</li>
          <li>Genesis 26-21, 22: And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</li>
          <li>Genesis 42-6, 7: And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</li>
          <li>Genesis 46-33, 34: And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</li>
          <li>Exodus 10-10, 11, 12: 10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.</li>
          <li>Exodus 19-9: And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</li>
          <li>Exodus 21-26, ..., 29: And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.</li>
          <li>Exodus 32-11, 12, 13: And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</li>
          <li>Exodus 33-12, 13: And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me.

Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.</li>
          <li>Exodus 34-12, 13, 14: Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
          <li>Leviticus 10-3: Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</li>
          <li>Leviticus 14-38, ..., 42: Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days: And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-283: If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security can be taken. If you trust one another, then ˹there is no need for a security, but˺ the debtor should honour this trust ˹by repaying the debt˺—and let them fear Allah, their Lord. And do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are indeed sinful. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-184: If you are rejected by them, so too were messengers before you who came with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 4-76: Believers fight for the cause of Allah, whereas disbelievers fight for the cause of the Devil. So fight against Satan’s ˹evil˺ forces. Indeed, Satan’s schemes are ever weak. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-167: Those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah have certainly strayed far away. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-180: Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names.1 They will be punished for what they used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-199: Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act ignorantly. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-7: ˹Remember, O  believers,˺ when Allah promised ˹to give˺ you the upper hand over either target, you wished to capture the unarmed party.1 But it was Allah’s Will to establish the truth by His Words and uproot the disbelievers; </li>
          <li>Quran 9-46: Had they ˹really˺ intended to march forth, they would have made preparations for it. But Allah disliked that they should go, so He let them lag behind, and it was said ˹to them˺, “Stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-65, 66: If you question them, they will certainly say, “We were only talking idly and joking around.” Say, “Was it Allah, His revelations, and His Messenger that you ridiculed?” Make no excuses! You have lost faith after your belief. If We pardon a group of you,1 We will punish others for their wickedness. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-83: If Allah returns you ˹O Prophet˺ to a group of them and they ask to go forth with you, say, “You will not ever go forth or fight an enemy along with me. You preferred to stay behind the first time, so stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-108: Do not ˹O Prophet˺ ever pray in it. Certainly, a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy of your prayers. In it are men who love to be purified.1 And Allah loves those who purify themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-29: O  my people! I do not ask you for a payment for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from Allah. And I will never dismiss the believers, for they will surely meet their Lord. But I can see that you are a people acting ignorantly. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-4, 5:˹Remember˺ when Joseph said to his father, “O my dear father! Indeed I dreamt of eleven stars, and the sun, and the moon—I saw them prostrating to me!”1 He replied, “O my dear son! Do not relate your vision to your brothers, or they will devise a plot against you. Surely Satan is a sworn enemy to humankind. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-67: He then instructed ˹them˺, “O my sons! Do not enter ˹the city˺ all through one gate, but through separate gates.1 I cannot help you against ˹what is destined by˺ Allah in the least. It is only Allah Who decides. In Him I put my trust. And in Him let the faithful put their trust.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-4: We have not sent a messenger except in the language of his people to clarify ˹the message˺ for them. Then Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-60: To those who disbelieve in the Hereafter belong all evil qualities, whereas to Allah belong the finest attributes. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise. </li>

          <li>Quran 18-28: And patiently stick with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure.1 Do not let your eyes look beyond them, desiring the luxuries of this worldly life. And do not obey those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow ˹only˺ their desires and whose state is ˹total˺ loss. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-58: Those were ˹some of˺ the prophets who Allah has blessed from among the descendants of Adam, and of those We carried with Noah ˹in the Ark˺, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel,1 and of those We ˹rightly˺ guided and chose. Whenever the revelations of the Most Compassionate were recited to them, they fell down, prostrating and weeping. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-8: We did not give those messengers ˹supernatural˺ bodies that did not need food, nor were they immortal. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-68, 69, 70: Is it because they have never contemplated the Word ˹of Allah˺? Or ˹because˺ there has come to them something that did not come to their forefathers? Or ˹because˺ they failed to recognize their Messenger, and so they denied him? Or ˹because˺ they say, “He is insane?” In fact, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are resentful of the truth. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-76: And We have already seized them with torment, but they never humbled themselves to their Lord, nor did they ˹submissively˺ appeal ˹to Him˺. </li>

          <li>Quran 24-46: We have indeed sent down revelations clarifying ˹the truth˺. But Allah ˹only˺ guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-8: We have commanded people to honour their parents. But if they urge you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of,1 then do not obey them. To Me you will ˹all˺ return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-44: Allah created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. Surely in this is a sign for the people of faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-53: Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe in Our revelations, ˹fully˺ submitting ˹to Allah˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-15: But if they pressure you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of,1 do not obey them. Still keep their company in this world courteously, and follow the way of those who turn to Me ˹in devotion˺. Then to Me you will ˹all˺ return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-48: Do not yield to the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Overlook their annoyances, and put your trust in Allah. For Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.</li>
          <li>Quran 36-11: You can only warn those who follow the Reminder1 and are in awe of the Most Compassionate without seeing Him.2 So give them good news of forgiveness and an honourable reward. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-7: If you disbelieve, then ˹know that˺ Allah is truly not in need of you, nor does He approve of disbelief from His servants. But if you become grateful ˹through faith˺, He will appreciate that from you. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He certainly knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-15: Worship then whatever ˹gods˺ you want instead of Him.” Say, “The ˹true˺ losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on Judgment Day. That is indeed the clearest loss.” </li>
          <li>Quran 41-7: those who do not pay alms-tax and are in denial of the Hereafter. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-18: Those who disbelieve in it ˹ask to˺ hasten it ˹mockingly˺. But the believers are fearful of it, knowing that it is the truth. Surely those who dispute about the Hour have gone far astray. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-18: Now We have set you ˹O Prophet˺ on the ˹clear˺ Way of faith. So follow it, and do not follow the desires of those who do not know ˹the truth˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-23: He responded, “The knowledge ˹of its time˺ is only with Allah. I only convey to you what I have been sent with. But I can see that you are a people acting ignorantly.” </li>
          <li>Quran 51-53: Have they passed this ˹cliché˺ down to one another? In fact, they have ˹all˺ been a transgressing people. </li>
          <li>Quran 53-29, 30: So turn away ˹O Prophet˺ from whoever has shunned Our Reminder,1 only seeking the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world. This is the extent of their knowledge. Surely your Lord knows best who has strayed from His Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-20: The residents of the Fire cannot be equal to the residents of Paradise. ˹Only˺ the residents of Paradise will be successful. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 14: Just as rain cannot penetrate a well-roofed house, so also, passion (raga) cannot
            penetrate a mind well-cultivated in Tranquillity and Insight Development (Samatha and Vipassana)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 22: Fully comprehending this, the wise, who are mindful, rejoice in being mindful and
            find delight in the domain of the Noble Ones (Ariyas)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 28: The wise one dispels negligence by means of mindfulness; he ascends the tower of
            wisdom and being free from sorrow looks at the sorrowing beings. Just as one on the mountain top looks at
            those on the plain below, so also, the wise one (the arahat) looks at the foolish and the ignorant
            (worldlings).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 75: Indeed, the path that leads to worldly gain is one and the Path that leads to
            Nibbana is another. Fully comprehending this, the bhikkhu, the disciple of the Buddha, should not take
            delight in worldly gain and honour, but devote himself to solitude, detachment and the realization of
            Nibbana. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Lakundaka Bhaddiya: "An arahat never loses his temper, he has no desire to speak
            harshly or to think ill of others. He is like a mountain of solid rock; as a solid rock is unshaken, so
            also, an arahat is unperturbed by scorn or by praise."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 81: As a mountain of rock is unshaken by wind, so also, the wise are unperturbed by
            blame or by praise. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 83: Indeed, the virtuous give up all (i.e., attachment to the five khandhas, etc.); the
            virtuous (lit., the tranquil) do not talk with sensual desire; when faced with joy or sorrow, the wise do
            not show elation or depression. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 91: The mindful strive diligently (in the Tranquillity and Insight Development
            Practice); they take no delight in the home (i.e., in the life of sensual pleasures); like swans (hamsa)
            that forsake the muddy pool, they abandon all home life (i.e., all cravings). /li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 92: Arahats do not hoard (anything); when taking food they reflect well over it (i.e.,
            in accordance with the three parinnas).* They have as their object liberation from existence, that is,
            Nibbana which is Void and Signless. Their destination, like the course of birds in the air, cannot be
            traced. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 93: The arahat is free from moral intoxicants (asavas); he is not attached to food. He
            has as his object liberation from existence, i.e., Nibbana which is Void and Signless. His path, like that
            of birds in the air, cannot be traced. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 95: Like the earth, the arahat is patient and is not provoked to respond in anger; like
            the door-post he is firm; he is unperturbed by the ups and downs of life; he is serene and pure like a
            lake free from mud. For such an arahat there will be no more rebirth. </li>
          <li>The Story of a Samanera from Kosambi: The Buddha listened to him, and replied, "My son, an arahat does not
            get angry with anyone he is restrained in his senses and is perfectly calm and serene."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 171: Come, look at this world (i.e., the five khandhas), which is like an ornamented
            royal carriage. Fools flounder in this world of the khandhas, but the wise are not attached to it. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Raised by Thera Ananda: After reflecting thus, Thera Ananda went to the Buddha,
            and put to him the question of the noblest of men. To him the Buddha replied, "Ananda, the noblest of men is
            not born everywhere, he is born only among Khattiyamahasala and Brahmanamahasala, the wealthy clans of
            Khattiya and Brahmana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 296: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night
            are always mindful of the qualities of the Buddha.
            Verse 297: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always
            mindful of the qualities of the Dhamma.
            Verse 298: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always
            mindful of the qualities of the Samgha.
            Verse 299: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always
            mindful of the component parts of the body.
            Verse 300: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, whose mind by day and by night
            always takes delight in being compassionate (lit., harmless).
            Verse 301: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, whose mind by day and by night
            always takes delight in the cultivation (of good-will towards all).
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 351: He who has attained arahatship is free from fear, free from craving, and free from
            moral defilements. He has cut off the thorns of existence (such as lust). This is the last existence (for
            him).
            Verse 352: He who is free from craving and from attachment, who is skilled in the knowledge of the
            significance of terms, who knows the grouping of letters and their sequence is indeed called "one who has
            lived his last, a man of great wisdom, a great man."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 363: The bhikkhu who controls his mouth (speech) who speaks wisely with his mind
            composed, who explains the meaning and the text of the Dhamma, — sweet are the words of that bhikkhu.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 378: The bhikkhu who is calm in body, calm in speech, and calm in mind, who is
            well-composed and has given up (lit., vomited) worldly pleasures, is called a "Tranquil One".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 385: Him I call a brahmana who has for him neither this shore (i.e., the sense-bases) nor
            the other shore (i.e., the sense objects), and who is undistressed and free from moral defilements1.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 386: Him I call a brahmana, who dwells in seclusion practising Tranquility and Insight
            Meditation and is free from taints (of moral defilements); who has performed his duties, and is free from
            moral intoxicants (asavas) and has reached the highest goal (arahatship).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 388: Because he has discarded evil he is called a 'brahmana'; because he lives calmly he
            is called a 'samana'; and because he gets rid of his impurities he is called a 'pabbajita'.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Back at the monastery, the bhikkhus told the Buddha how the Venerable
            Sariputta had patiently borne the scolding and abuses of his mother. To them, the Buddha said that arahats
            never get angry, they never lose their temper.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 400: Him I call a brahmana, who is free from anger, who practises austerity, who is
            virtuous and free from craving, who is controlled in his senses and for whom this body (i.e., existence) is
            the very last.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Uppalavanna*: In this connection, they asked the Buddha whether arahats do not enjoy
            sensual pleasures as they have the same physical make-up like any other people. To them the Buddha replied,
            "Bhikkhus! Arahats do not enjoy sensual pleasures; they do not indulge in sensual pleasures, for they do not
            cling to objects of sense and to sensual pleasures, just as water does not cling to the lotus leaf or the
            mustard seed to the tip of an awl."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 402: Him I call a brahmana, who even in this existence realizes the end of dukkha (i.e.,
            Nibbana), who has laid down the burden (of the khandhas) and who is free from moral defilements.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Khema*: Sakka asked the Buddha who that bhikkhuni was and the Buddha replied, "She is
            one of my pre-eminent disciples; she is known as Theri Khema. She is matchless amongst the bhikkhunis in
            wisdom and she knows how to differentiate the right way from the wrong way."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 407: Him I call a brahmana, from whom passion, ill will, pride and detraction have fallen

          <li>The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the
            sanctions of the law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive (C.A. 116)</li>
          <li>The mind of a superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with

          <li>The philosopher Tsang said, "Suppose that there is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of
            a
            young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority over a state of a hundred li, and whom no
            emergency however great can drive from his principles:-is such a man a superior man? He is a superior man
            indeed (C.A. quote 268)</li>

          <li>
            When Ch'ih was proceeding to Chi'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard
            that a superior man helps the distressed, but does not add to the wealth of the rich (C.A. quote 180)
          </li>
          <li>He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good (C.A. quote 329)</li>

          <li>"Cautious and slow in his speech!" said Niu;-"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?" The Master said,
            "When a man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?" (C.A.
            quote
            460)</li>
          <li>Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, "The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear
            (C.A. quote 461)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, "He with whom neither slander that
            gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may
            be
            called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are
            successful, may be called farseeing." (C.A. quote 467)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to
            perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this." (C.A. quote 486)</li>
          <li>Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's
            words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be
            distinguished in the country; he will be distinguished in his clan (C.A. quote 494)</li>

          <li>The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear (C.A. quote 332)
          </li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man is affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not
            affable (C.A) quote 552)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in
            any way which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses
            them according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you try to
            please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his
            employment of men, he wishes to be equal to everything." (C.A. quote 554)</li>

          <li>The way of the superior man is threefold, but I am not equal to it. Virtuous, he is free from anxities;
            wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear (C.A. quote 604)</li>

          <li>Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "The cultivation of himself in
            reverential carefulness." "And is this all?" said Tzze-lu. "He cultivates himself so as to give rest to
            others," was the reply. "And is this all?" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, "He cultivates himself so
            as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao
            and
            Shun were still solicitous about this." (C.A. quote 628)</li>

          <li>The determined scholar and the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of injuring their
            virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to preserve their virtue complete (C.A. quote 646)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it
            according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This
            is
            indeed a superior man." (C.A. quote 659)</li>
          <li>The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him
            (C.A.
            quote 660)</li>
          <li>The superior man dislikes the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death (C.A. quote 661)

          <li>What the superior man seeks, is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others (C.A. quote 662)</li>
          <li>The superior man is dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a partisan (C.A. quote 663)
          </li>
          <li>The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words
            because of the man (C.A. quote 664)</li>
          <li>The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is
            sometimes want. So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man in anxious lest he should
            not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him (C.A. quote 674)</li>
          <li>The superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be interested with great concerns. The
            small man may not be interested with great concerns, but he may be known in little matters (C.A. quote
            678)
          </li>
          <li>The superior man is correctly firm, and not firm merely (C.A. quote 681)</li>
          <li>Therefore a superior man consider it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and
            also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in
            his words there may be nothing incorrect (C.A. quote 517)</li>
          <li>The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct (C.A. quote 130)</li>

          <li>The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the
            rules
            of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right (C.A. quote 204)</li>
          <li>There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of
            Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of the sages (C.A. quote 710)</li>
          <li>The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to
            the
            use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear
            distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his
            demeanor,
            he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be
            sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that is should be reverently careful. In regard
            to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties
            his anger may involve him in. When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness. (C.A. quote 713)
          </li>
          <li>Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil! and shrinking
            from
            it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:-I have seen such men, as I have heard such
            words (C.A. quote 714)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Has the superior man his hatreds also?" The Master said, "He has his hatreds. He hates
            those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his
            superiors.
            He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and
            determined, and, at the same time, of contracted understanding." (C.A. quote 772)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern;
            when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided." (C.A. quote
            812)
          </li>
          <li>Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man,
            and, at the same time, virtuous (C.A. quote 567)</li>
          <li>He had four of the characteristics of a superior man-in his conduct of himself, he was humble; in
            serving
            his superior, he was respectful; in nourshing the people, he was kind; in ordering the people, he was just
            (C.A. quote 156)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The

          <li>Quran 63-8: They say, “If we return to Medina, the honourable will definitely expel the inferior.” But all honour and power belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, yet the hypocrites do not know.</li>
          <li>Quran 66-8: O believers! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance, so your Lord may absolve you of your sins and admit you into Gardens, under which rivers flow, on the Day Allah will not disgrace the Prophet or the believers with him. Their light will shine ahead of them and on their right. They will say, “Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us. ˹For˺ You are truly Most Capable of everything.” </li>
          <li>Quran 72-25, ..., 28: Say, “I do not know if what you are promised is near or my Lord has set a distant time for it. ˹He is the˺ Knower of the unseen, disclosing none of it to anyone, except messengers of His choice. Then He appoints angel-guards before and behind them to ensure that the messengers fully deliver the messages of their Lord—though He ˹already˺ knows all about them, and keeps account of everything.” </li>
          <li>Quran 76-7: They ˹are those who˺ fulfil ˹their˺ vows and fear a Day of sweeping horror, </li>
          <li>Quran 79-40, 41: And as for those who were in awe of standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from ˹evil˺ desires, Paradise will certainly be ˹their˺ home. </li>
          <li>Quran 87-10: Those in awe ˹of Allah˺ will be mindful ˹of it˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 92-5, 6, 7: As for the one who is charitable, mindful ˹of Allah˺,  and ˹firmly˺ believes in the finest reward,  We will facilitate for them the Way of Ease. </li>
          <li>Quran 98-7, 8: Indeed, those who believe and do good—they are the best of ˹all˺ beings. Their reward with their Lord will be Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This is ˹only˺ for those in awe of their Lord. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 31: A bhikkhu who takes delight in mindfulness and sees danger in negligence, advances
            like fire, burning up all fetters, great and small.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 42: A thief may harm a thief; an enemy may harm an enemy; but a wrongly directed mind
            can
            do oneself far greater harm.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 34: As a fish quivers when taken out of its watery home and thrown on to dry ground, so
            does the mind quiver when it is taken out of the sensual world to escape from the realm of Mara (i.e.,
            kilesa vatta, round of moral defilements).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada verse 63: The fool who knows that he is a fool can, for that reason, be a wise man; but the
            fool who thinks that he is wise is, indeed, called a fool.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 64: A fool, even though he is associated with a wise man all his life, does not
            understand the Dhamma, just as a ladle does not know the taste of soup.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 65: An intelligent man, even though he is associated with a wise man only for a moment,
            quickly understands the Dhamma, just as the tongue knows the taste of soup.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 70: Even though, month after month, the fool (living in austerity) takes his food
            sparingly with the tip of a grass blade, he is not worth even one-sixteenth part of those who have
            comprehended the Truth (i.e., the ariyas).</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Mahakassapa: Then the other bhikkhus said scornfully, "Mahakassapa has not
            accompanied the Buddha, just as we have predicted!" The Buddha heard their remark and said to them,
            "Bhikkhus! Do you wish to say that my son Kassapa is attached to his lay disciples of Rajagaha and to the
            things they offer him? You are very much mistaken. My son Kassapa remains here under my instruction; he is
            not attached to anything here."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu like Sariputta has no anger or ill
            will in him. Like the earth and the door-post, he is patient, tolerant, and firm; like the lake free from
            mud, he is serene and pure."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 111: Better than a hundred years in the life of an ignorant person, who has no control
            over his senses, is a day in the life of a wise man who cultivates Tranquillity and Insight Development
            Practice.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sappadasa: To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! Yes, it is possible; for one who is
            zealous and strenuous in the practice of Tranquillity and Insight Development, arahatship can be gained in
            an instant. As the bhikkhu walks in meditation, he can attain arahatship even before his raised foot touches
            the ground."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 112: Better than a hundred years in the life of a person who is idle and inactive, is a
            day in the life of one who makes a zealous and strenuous effort (in Tranquillity and Insight Development
            Practice). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 114: Better than a hundred years in the life of a person who does not perceive the
            Deathless (Nibbana), is a day in the life of one who perceives the Deathless (Nibbana). </li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Bahuputtika: "The life of one who does not practise the Dhamma taught by me is useless,
            even if he were to live for a hundred years."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 115: Better than a hundred years in the life of a person who does not comprehend the
            Noble Dhamma (Dhammamuttamam), is a day in the life of one who comprehends the Noble Dhamma. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 135: As with a stick the cowherd drives his cattle to the pasture, so also, ageing and
            death drive the life of beings.</li>
          <li>The Story of Bhikkhu Bahubhandika: The Buddha then said to him, "Standing there without your upper robe is
            not proper; just discarding your robe etc., does not maker you an austere bhikkhu; a bhikkhu must also
            discard his doubt."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 141: Not going naked, nor having matted hair, nor smearing oneself with mud, nor fasting,
            nor sleeping on bare ground, nor covering oneself with dust, nor striving by squatting can purify a being,
            who has not yet overcome doubt. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Mother of Kumarakassapa: One day, at the congregation of bhikkhus, some bhikkhus said to
            the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! If the mother of Kumarakassapa had listened to Devadatta, she as well as her son
            would not have become arahats. Surely, Devadatta had tried to do them a great wrong; but you, Venerable Sir,
            are a refuge to them!" To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! In trying to reach the deva world, or in trying
            to attain arahatship, you cannot depend on others, you must work hard on your own."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Weaver-Girl: Hearing her answers, the audience thought that the young weaver was being
            very disrespectful. Then, the Buddha asked her to explain what she meant by her answers, and she explained.
            "Venerable Sir! Since you know that I have come from my house, I interpreted that, by your first question,
            you meant to ask me from what past existence I have come here. Hence my answer, 'I do not know.' The second
            question means, to what future existence I would be going from here; hence my answer, 'I do not know.' The
            third question means whether I do not know that I would die one day; hence my answer, 'yes, I do know.' The
            last question means whether I know when I would die; hence my answer, 'I do not know.

            The Buddha was satisfied with her explanation and he said to the audience, "Most of you might not understand
            clearly the meaning of the answers given by the young weaver. Those who are ignorant are in darkness, they
            are just like the blind."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 174: Blind are the people of this world: only a few in this world see clearly (with
            Insight). Just as only a few birds escape from the net, so also, only a few get to the world of the devas,
            (and Nibbana).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 271 & 272: Not only by mere moral practice, nor by much learning, nor by acquiring
            concentration, nor by dwelling in seclusion, nor by assuring oneself, "I enjoy the bliss of Anagami Fruition
            that is not enjoyed by common worldlings (puthujjanas)," should the bhikkhu, rest content without attaining
            the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavas) [i.e., without attaining arahatship]. </li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: The Buddha came to them in the midst of their conversation and said to
            them, "Bhikkhus, the path you are talking about is external to you; a bhikkhu should only be concerned with
            the path of the Noble Ones (ariyas) and strive to do what should be done for the attainment of the Ariya
            Path (Magga) that leads to the realization of the Perfect Peace (Nibbana).</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Bhaddiya, the Short One: The Buddha called their attention to the short thera and said
            to them, "Bhikkhus, look at that thera. He has killed both his father and his mother, and having killed his
            parents he goes about without any dukkha."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Woman of Jealous Disposition: So the Buddha said, "Do no evil, thinking that people will
            not know about it. An evil deed done in secret, when discovered, will bring much pain and sorrow; but a good
            deed may be done secretly, for it can only bring happiness and not sorrow."</li>
          <li>The Story of Many Bhikkhus: On learning about the hardships they had undergone during the vassa, the
            Buddha said to them "Bhikkhus, do not keep thinking about this or anything else; it is always difficult to
            have a carefree, effortless living. Just as the townsfolk guard their town, so also, a bhikkhu should be on
            guard and keep his mind steadfastly on his body."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 345 & 346: The wise do not say that bonds made of iron, of wood, and of hemp are strong
            bonds; they say that only passionate attachment to and care for gems and jewelry, children and wives are
            strong bonds. These drag one down (to lower planes of existence) and although they seem yielding are
            difficult to unfasten. The wise, cutting off this bond (of craving) and resolutely giving up sensual
            pleasures, renounce the world.</li>
          <li>The story of Samenra Sumana: At the congregation of the bhikkhus in the evening, the bhikkhus told the
            Buddha about the wonderful trip made by Samanera Sumana. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, one who
            practises the Dhamma vigilantly and zealously is capable of attaining supernormal powers, even though he is
            young."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 392: If from somebody one should learn the Teaching of the Buddha, he should respectfully
            pay homage to that teacher, as a brahmin worships the sacrificial fire.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Abusive Brahmin Brothers: "What do we have to kill to be able to live happily and
            peacefully?" and his second question was, "Killing of what dhamma do you approve of?" To these questions,
            the Buddha replied, " O brahmin, to be able to live happily and peacefully, one will have to kill ill will
            (dosa). Killing one's ill will is liked and praised by the Buddhas and the arahats." </li>
          <li>The Story of Devahita the Brahmin: After drinking the mixture there was instant relief. The brahmin then
            came and asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! An offering made to whom gives one the greatest benefit?" To him
            the Buddha said, "Brahmin! An offering made to one who has given up all evil is the most beneficial."</li>

          <li>Genesis 1-26: And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</li>
          <li>Genesis 3-14: And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</li>
          <li>Genesis 39-3: And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</li>
          <li>Exodus 6-12: And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?</li>
          <li>Exodus 9-19, 20, 21: Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.</li>
          <li>Exodus 13-5: And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.</li>
          <li>Exodus 13-3, 4: For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

          <li>Exodus 22-19, 20, 21: Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed. Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</li>

The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.</li>

            Quran 2-26: Surely Allah does not shy away from using the parable of a mosquito or what is even smaller. As
            for the believers, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And as for the disbelievers, they argue,
            “What does Allah mean by such a parable?” Through this ˹test˺, He leaves many to stray, and guides many. And
            He leaves none to stray except the rebellious—
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-66: So We made their fate an example to present and future generations, and a lesson to the God-fearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-158: Indeed, the hills of Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever performs the pilgrimage or minor pilgrimage, let them walk between the two hills. And whoever does good willingly, Allah is truly Appreciative, All-knowing.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-257: Allah is the Guardian of the believers—He brings them out of darkness and into light. As for the disbelievers, their guardians are false gods who lead them out of light and into darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-13: Indeed, there was a sign for you in the two armies that met in battle—one fighting for the cause of Allah and the other in denial. The believers saw their enemy twice their number.1 But Allah supports with His victory whoever He wills. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-154: Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-166, 167: So what you suffered on the day the two armies met was by Allah’s Will, so that He might distinguish the ˹true˺ believers and expose the hypocrites. When it was said to them, “Come fight in the cause of Allah or ˹at least˺ defend yourselves,” they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief on that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. Allah is All-Knowing of what they hide.  </li>
          <li>Quran 3-175: That ˹warning˺ was only ˹from˺ Satan, trying to prompt you to fear his followers.1 So do not fear them; fear Me if you are ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-199: Indeed, there are some among the People of the Book who truly believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you ˹believers˺ and what was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah—never trading Allah’s revelations for a fleeting gain. Their reward is with their Lord. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-77: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who had been told, “Do not fight! Rather, establish prayer and pay alms-tax.”? Then once the order came to fight, a group of them feared those ˹hostile˺ people as Allah should be feared—or even more. They said, “Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to fight? If only You had delayed ˹the order for˺ us for a little while!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The enjoyment of this world is so little, whereas the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. And none of you will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-94: O believers! Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of your hands and spears to distinguish those who fear Him in secret. Whoever transgresses from now on will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-46: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if Allah were to take away your hearing or sight, or seal your hearts—who else other than Allah could restore it?” See ˹O Prophet˺ how We vary the signs, yet they still turn away. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-65: Say, “He ˹alone˺ has the power to unleash upon you a torment from above or below you or split you into ˹conflicting˺ factions and make you taste the violence of one another.” See how We vary the signs, so perhaps they will comprehend. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-4: ˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed! Our torment took them by surprise ˹while sleeping˺ at night or midday. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-17: It was not you ˹believers˺ who killed them, but it was Allah Who did so. Nor was it you ˹O Prophet˺ who threw ˹a handful of sand at the disbelievers˺,1 but it was Allah Who did so, rendering the believers a great favour. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-23: Had Allah known any goodness in them, He would have certainly made them hear. ˹But˺ even if He had made them hear, they would have surely turned away heedlessly. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-97: The nomadic Arabs ˹around Medina˺ are far worse in disbelief and hypocrisy, and less likely to know the laws revealed by Allah to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-110: The building which they erected will never cease to fuel hypocrisy in their hearts until their hearts are torn apart. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. 
          <li>Quran 10-6: Surely in the alternation of the day and the night, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are truly signs for those mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-24: The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky, producing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then just as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they have full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, so We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-108: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “This is my way. I invite to Allah with insight—I and those who follow me. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-4: And on the earth there are ˹different˺ neighbouring tracts, gardens of grapevines, ˹various˺ crops, palm trees—some stemming from the same root, others standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-6: ˹Consider˺ when Moses said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favour upon you when He rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-24, 25, 26, 27: Do you not see how Allah compares a good word to a good tree? Its root is firm and its branches reach the sky, ˹always˺ yielding its fruit in every season by the Will of its Lord. This is how Allah sets forth parables for the people, so perhaps they will be mindful. And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree, uprooted from the earth, having no stability. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-56: He exclaimed, “Who would despair of the mercy of their Lord except the misguided?” </li>
          <li>Quran 15-85: We have not created the heavens and the earth and everything in between except for a purpose. And the Hour is certain to come, so forgive graciously. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-30: And ˹when˺ it is said to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, “What has your Lord revealed?” They say, “All the best!” For those who do good in this world, there is goodness. But far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter. How excellent indeed is the home of the righteous: </li>
          <li>Quran 16-65: And Allah sends down rain from the sky, giving life to the earth after its death. Surely in this is a sign for those who listen. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-70: Allah has created you, and then causes you to die. And some of you are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-79: Have they not seen the birds glide in the open sky? None holds them up except Allah. Surely in this are signs for those who believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-108: They are the ones whose hearts, ears, and eyes are sealed by Allah, and it is they who are ˹truly˺ heedless. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-45, 46, 47:  When you ˹O Prophet˺ recite the Quran, We put a hidden barrier between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter. We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran, they turn their backs in aversion. We know best how they listen to your recitation and what they say privately—when the wrongdoers say, “You would only be following a bewitched man.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-110: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate—whichever you call, He has the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not recite your prayers too loudly or silently, but seek a way between. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-57: And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-83, 84: Do you ˹O Prophet˺ not see that We have sent the devils against the disbelievers, constantly inciting them? So do not be in haste against them, for indeed We are ˹closely˺ counting down their days. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-88, 89, 90, 91: They1 say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring.” You have certainly made an outrageous claim, by which the heavens are about to burst, the earth to split apart, and the mountains to crumble to pieces in protest of attributing children to the Most Compassionate. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-90: Aaron had already warned them beforehand, “O my people! You are only being tested by this, for indeed your ˹one true˺ Lord is the Most Compassionate. So follow me and obey my orders.” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-125, 126, 127: They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, although I used to see?” Allah will respond, “It is so, just as Our revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are neglected.” This is how We reward whoever transgresses and does not believe in the revelations of their Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-44: In fact, We have allowed enjoyment for these ˹Meccans˺ and their forefathers for such a long time ˹that they took it for granted˺. Do they not see that We gradually reduce ˹their˺ land from its borders? Is it they who will then prevail? </li>
          <li>Quran 22-15: Whoever thinks that Allah will not help His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter, let them stretch out a rope to the ceiling and strangle themselves, then let them see if this plan will do away with ˹the cause of˺ their rage.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 22-54: ˹This is˺ also so that those gifted with knowledge would know that this ˹revelation˺ is the truth from your Lord, so they have faith in it, and so their hearts would submit humbly to it. And Allah surely guides the believers to the Straight Path.</li>
          <li>Quran 24-35, 36, 37, 38: Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. His light1 is like a niche in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a crystal, the crystal is like a shining star, lit from ˹the oil of˺ a blessed olive tree, ˹located˺ neither to the east nor the west,2 whose oil would almost glow, even without being touched by fire. Light upon light! Allah guides whoever He wills to His light. And Allah sets forth parables for humanity. For Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. ˹That light shines˺ through houses ˹of worship˺ which Allah has ordered to be raised, and where His Name is mentioned. He is glorified there morning and evening by men1 who are not distracted—either by buying or selling—from Allah’s remembrance, or performing prayer, or paying alms-tax. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will tremble, ˹hoping˺ that Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and increase them out of His grace. And Allah provides for whoever He wills without limit. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-44: Allah alternates the day and night. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-31: Similarly, We made enemies for every prophet from among the wicked, but sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-86: Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest in and the day bright?1 Surely in this are signs for those who believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-35: And We did leave ˹some of˺ its ruins as a clear lesson for people of understanding. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-41: The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a spider spinning a shelter. And the flimsiest of all shelters is certainly that of a spider, if only they knew.1</li>
          <li>Quran 29-67: Have they not seen how We have made ˹Mecca˺ a safe haven, whereas people ˹all˺ around them are snatched away?1 How can they then believe in falsehood2 and deny Allah’s favours? </li>
          <li>Quran 30-8: Have they not reflected upon their own being? Allah only created the heavens and the earth and everything in between for a purpose and an appointed term. Yet most people are truly in denial of the meeting with their Lord! </li>
          <li>Quran 30-54: It is Allah Who created you in a state of weakness, then developed ˹your˺ weakness into strength, then developed ˹your˺ strength into weakness and old age.1 He creates whatever He wills. For He is the All-Knowing, Most Capable. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-27: If all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean ˹were ink˺, refilled by seven other oceans, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 35-9: And it is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up ˹vapour, forming˺ clouds, and then We drive them to a lifeless land, giving life to the earth after its death. Similar is the Resurrection. </li>
          <li>Quran 36-8, 9, 10: ˹It is as if˺ We have put shackles around their necks up to their chins, so their heads are forced up, and have placed a barrier before them and a barrier behind them and covered them ˹all˺ up, so they fail to see ˹the truth˺. It is the same whether you warn them or not—they will never believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 36-33, ..., 35: There is a sign for them in the dead earth: We give it life, producing grain from it for them to eat. And We have placed in it gardens of palm trees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth in it, so that they may eat from its fruit, which they had no hand in making. Will they not then give thanks? </li>
          <li>Quran 38-28: We have not created the heavens and earth and everything in between without purpose—as the disbelievers think. So woe to the disbelievers because of the Fire! </li>
          <li>Quran 39-49: When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to Us ˹alone˺. Then when We shower Our blessings upon them, they say, “I have been granted all this only because of ˹my˺ knowledge.” Not at all! It is ˹no more than˺ a test. But most of them do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-66: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have been forbidden to worship those ˹idols˺ you worship besides Allah, since clear proofs have come to me from my Lord. And I have been commanded to ˹fully˺ submit to the Lord of all worlds.” </li>
          <li>Quran 41-39: And among His signs is that you see the earth devoid of life, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell. Indeed, the One Who revives it can easily revive the dead. He is certainly Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-53: We will show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that this ˹Quran˺ is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a Witness over all things? </li>
          <li>Quran 45-3, 4: Surely in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens and the earth are signs for the believers. And in your own creation, and whatever living beings He dispersed, are signs for people of sure faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 47-31: We will certainly test you ˹believers˺ until We prove those of you who ˹truly˺ struggle ˹in Allah’s cause˺ and remain steadfast, and reveal how you conduct yourselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-24: He is the One Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of ˹Ḥudaibiyah, near˺ Mecca, after giving you the upper hand over ˹a group of˺ them.1 And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-20, 21: There are ˹countless˺ signs on earth for those with sure faith,  as there are within yourselves. Can you not see? </li>
          <li>Quran 53-31: To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth so that He may reward the evildoers according to what they did, and reward the good-doers with the finest reward1— </li>
          <li>Quran 54-51: We have already destroyed the likes of you. So will any ˹of you˺ be mindful? </li>
          <li>Quran 56-63, ..., 67: Have you considered what you sow? Is it you who cause it to grow, or is it We Who do so?  If We willed, We could simply reduce this ˹harvest˺ to chaff, leaving you to lament, “We have truly suffered a ˹great˺ loss.  In fact, we have been deprived ˹of our livelihood˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 56-68, ..., 70: Have you considered the water you drink?  Is it you who bring it down from the clouds, or is it We Who do so?  If We willed, We could make it salty. Will you not then give thanks? </li>
          <li>Quran 56-71, ..., 73: Have you considered the fire you kindle?1 Is it you who produce its trees, or is it We Who do so? We have made it ˹as˺ a reminder ˹of the Hellfire˺ and a provision for the travellers. </li>
          <li>Quran 56-85: And We are nearer to such a person than you, but you cannot see. </li>
          <li>Quran 57-17: Know that Allah revives the earth after its death.1 We have certainly made the signs clear for you so perhaps you will understand. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-2: He is the One Who expelled the disbelievers of the People of the Book from their homes for ˹their˺ first banishment ˹ever˺. You never thought they would go. And they thought their strongholds would put them out of Allah’s reach. But ˹the decree of˺ Allah came upon them from where they never expected. And He cast horror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers.1 So take a lesson ˹from this˺, O  people of insight! </li>
          <li>Quran 67-2: ˹He is the One˺ Who created death and life in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And He is the Almighty, All-Forgiving. </li>
          <li>Quran 67-28: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider this: whether Allah causes me and those with me to die or shows us mercy, who will save the disbelievers from a painful punishment?”1 </li>
          <li>Quran 75-36, ..., 40:  Do people think they will be left without purpose? Were they not ˹once˺ a sperm-drop emitted? Then they became a clinging clot ˹of blood˺,1 then He developed and perfected their form, producing from it both sexes, male and female. Is such ˹a Creator˺ unable to bring the dead back to life? </li>
          <li>Quran 76-1, 2: Is there not a period of time when each human is nothing yet worth mentioning?1 ˹For˺ indeed, We ˹alone˺ created humans from a drop of mixed fluids,1 ˹in order˺ to test them, so We made them hear and see. </li>
          <li>Quran 83-19, 20, 21: and what will make you realize what ’Illiyûn is?—  a fate ˹already˺ sealed,  witnessed by those nearest ˹to Allah˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 90-8, 9, 10: Have We not given them two eyes,  a tongue, and two lips;  and shown them the two ways ˹of right and wrong˺? </li>   
          <li>Quran 92-12, 13: It is certainly upon Us ˹alone˺ to show ˹the way to˺ guidance.  And surely to Us ˹alone˺ belong this life and the next.  </li>

            Quran 2-259: Or ˹are you not aware of˺ the one who passed by a city which was in ruins. He wondered, “How could Allah bring this back to life after its destruction?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then brought him back to life. Allah asked, “How long have you remained ˹in this state˺?” He replied, “Perhaps a day or part of a day.” Allah said, “No! You have remained here for a hundred years! Just look at your food and drink—they have not spoiled. ˹But now˺ look at ˹the remains of˺ your donkey! And ˹so˺ We have made you into a sign for humanity. And look at the bones ˹of the donkey˺, how We bring them together then clothe them with flesh!”1 When this was made clear to him, he declared, “˹Now˺ I know that Allah is Most Capable of everything.”

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 173: He who overwhelms with good the evil that he has done lights up this world (with the
            light of Magga Insight), as does the moon freed from clouds. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thirty Bhikkhus: Once, thirty bhikkhus came to pay homage to the Buddha. When they came in,
            the Venerable Ananda, who was then attending on the Buddha, left the room and waited outside. After some
            time, Thera Ananda went in, but he did not find any of the bhikkhus. So, he asked the Buddha where all those
            bhikkhus had gone. The Buddha then replied, "Ananda, all those bhikkhus, after hearing my discourse, had
            attained arahatship, and with their supernormal powers, they let travelling through space."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 175: Swans travel in the sky; those with supernormal powers travel through space; the
            wise having conquered Mara together with his army, go out of this world (i.e., realize Nibbana). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 208: Therefore one should follow a resolute, intelligent, learned, persevering and
            dutiful ariya; follow such a virtuous and wise man, as the moon follows the path of the stars.</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Lay-disciples: Thera Ananda then asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! What are the things
            that prevent people from being able to take in the Dhamma?" And the Buddha replied, "Ananda, passion (raga),
            ill will (dosa) and ignorance (moha) are the three things that prevent people from taking in the Dhamma.
            Passion burns one; there is no fire like passion. The world may burn up when seven suns rise in the sky, but
            that happens very rarely. Passion burns always and without any break."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 387: By day shines the sun; by night shines the moon; in regalia shines the king; in
            meditation shines the arahat; but the Buddha in his glory shines at all times, by day and by night.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 413: Him I call a brahmana, who, like the moon (in a cloudless sky), is pure, clear and
            serene, and in whom craving for existence is extinct.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Nataputtaka: While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (418)
            of this book, with reference to another Thera Nataputtaka, son of another dancer.
            As in the previous story, the son of a dancer had entered the Order and had attained arahatship.</li>

          <li>He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps

          <li>Tsze-kung said, "The faults of the superior man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his

          <li>Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken reviling of Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, "It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni
            cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over.
            Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself
            off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own

And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

            Quran 2-189: They ask you O Prophet about the phases of the moon. Say, "They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage."

So enter your homes through their proper doors, and be mindful of Allah so you may be successful.

          <li>Quran 2-258: Are you ˹O Prophet˺ not aware of the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord because Allah had granted him kingship? ˹Remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord is the One Who has power to give life and cause death.” He argued, “I too have the power to give life and cause death.” Abraham challenged ˹him˺, “Allah causes the sun to rise from the east. So make it rise from the west.” And so the disbeliever was dumbstruck. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-75, 76, 77, 78, 79: We also showed Abraham the wonders of the heavens and the earth, so he would be sure in faith. When the night grew dark upon him, he saw a star and said, “This is my Lord!” But when it set, he said, “I do not love things that set.” Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This one is my Lord!” But when it disappeared, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will certainly be one of the misguided people.” Then when he saw the sun shining, he said, “This must be my Lord—it is the greatest!” But again when it set, he declared, “O my people! I totally reject whatever you associate ˹with Allah in worship˺. I have turned my face towards the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth—being upright—and I am not one of the polytheists.”</li>
          <li>Quran 9-36: Indeed, the number of months ordained by Allah is twelve—in Allah’s Record1 since the day He created the heavens and the earth—of which four are sacred. That is the Right Way. So do not wrong one another during these months. And together fight the polytheists as they fight against you together. And know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-37: Reallocating the sanctity of ˹these˺ months1 is an increase in disbelief, by which the disbelievers are led ˹far˺ astray. They adjust the sanctity one year and uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified by Allah, violating the very months Allah has made sacred. Their evil deeds have been made appealing to them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-5: He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and the moon a reflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so that you may know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. Allah did not create all this except for a purpose. He makes the signs clear for people of knowledge. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-2: It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars—as you can see—then established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair. He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. 
          <li>Quran 13-3: And He is the One Who spread out the earth and placed firm mountains and rivers upon it, and created fruits of every kind in pairs.1 He covers the day with night. Surely in this are signs for those who reflect. </li>

          <li>Quran 14-48, 49, 50: ˹Watch for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the earth will be changed into a different earth and the heavens as well, and all will appear before Allah—the One, the Supreme. On that Day you will see the wicked bound together in chains, with garments of tar, and their faces covered with flames. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-16, 17, 18: Indeed, We have placed constellations in the sky, and adorned it for all to see.  And We protected it from every accursed devil, except the one eavesdropping, who is then pursued by a visible flare.1 </li>

          <li>Quran 29-61: If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon ˹for your benefit˺, they will certainly say, “Allah!” How can they then be deluded ˹from the truth˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 31-29: Do you not see that Allah causes the night to merge into the day and the day into the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term, and that Allah is All-Aware of what you do? </li>
          <li>Quran 32-4: It is Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth and everything in between in six Days,1 then established Himself on the Throne. You have no protector or intercessor besides Him. Will you not then be mindful? </li>
          <li>Quran 35-13: He merges the night into the day and the day into the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. That is Allah—your Lord!

          <li>Quran 35-41: Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ keeps the heavens and the earth from falling apart. If they were to fall apart, none but Him could hold them up. He is truly Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving. </li>

          <li>Quran 39-67: They have not shown Allah His proper reverence—when on the Day of Judgment the ˹whole˺ earth will be in His Grip, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺! </li>
          <li>Quran 40-57: The creation of the heavens and the earth is certainly greater than the re-creation of humankind, but most people do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-9: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “How can you disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in two Days? And how can you set up equals with Him? That is the Lord of all worlds. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-10: He placed on the earth firm mountains, standing high, showered His blessings upon it, and ordained ˹all˺ its means of sustenance—totaling four Days exactly1—for all who ask. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-11: Then He turned towards the heaven when it was ˹still like˺ smoke, saying to it and to the earth, ‘Submit, willingly or unwillingly.’ They both responded, ‘We submit willingly.’ </li>
          <li>Quran 41-12: So He formed the heaven into seven heavens in two Days, assigning to each its mandate. And We adorned the lowest heaven with ˹stars like˺ lamps ˹for beauty˺ and for protection. That is the design of the Almighty, All-Knowing.”1  </li>
          <li>Quran 41-37: Among His signs are the day and the night, the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but prostrate to Allah, Who created them ˹all˺, if you ˹truly˺ worship Him ˹alone˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-5: The heavens nearly burst, one above the other, ˹in awe of Him˺. And the angels glorify the praises of their Lord, and seek forgiveness for those on earth. Surely Allah alone is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>

          <li>Quran 48-4, 5: He is the One Who sent down serenity upon the hearts of the believers so that they may increase even more in their faith. To Allah ˹alone˺ belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. So He may admit believing men and women into Gardens under which rivers flow—to stay there forever—and absolve them of their sins. And that is a supreme achievement in the sight of Allah. </li>

          <li>Quran 50-6: Have they not then looked at the sky above them: how We built it and adorned it ˹with stars˺, leaving it flawless? </li>
          <li>Quran 51-47: We built the universe with ˹great˺ might, and We are certainly expanding ˹it˺. As for the earth, We spread it out. How superbly did We smooth it out!1</li>

          <li>Quran 67-5:  And indeed, We adorned the lowest heaven with ˹stars like˺ lamps, and made them ˹as missiles˺ for stoning ˹eavesdropping˺ devils, for whom We have also prepared the torment of the Blaze.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 71-15, 16, 17: Do you not see how Allah created seven heavens, one above the other,  placing the moon within them as a ˹reflected˺ light, and the sun as a ˹radiant˺ lamp? </li>
          <li>Quran 78-6, ..., 16: Have We not smoothed out the earth ˹like a bed˺, and ˹made˺ the mountains as ˹its˺ pegs,1 and created you in pairs, and made your sleep for rest, and made the night as a cover, and made the day for livelihood, and built above you seven mighty ˹heavens˺, and placed ˹in them˺ a shining lamp, and sent down from rainclouds pouring water, producing by it grain and ˹various˺ plants, and dense orchards? </li>      
          <li>Quran 86-1, ..., 3: By the heaven and the nightly star!  And what will make you realize what the nightly star is?  ˹It is˺ the star of piercing brightness.  </li>
          <li>Quran 91-1, ..., 10: By the sun and its brightness, and the moon as it follows it,1  and the day as it unveils it,  and the night as it conceals it! And by heaven and ˹the One˺ Who built it, and the earth and ˹the One˺ Who spread it! And by the soul and ˹the One˺ Who fashioned it,  then with ˹the knowledge of˺ right and wrong inspired it! Successful indeed is the one who purifies their soul,  and doomed is the one who corrupts it! </li>

          <li>The Story of Thera Anuruddha: To those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, do not think my son
            Anuruddha has asked his relatives and lay disciples to send rice gruel and other foods. My son the thera
            did not ask for anything; arahats do not talk about such things like food and clothing. The excessive
            amount of food brought to the monastery this morning was due to the promptings of a celestial being and
            not of a man."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Mahakaccayana: The bhikkhus were awed by Sakka paying obeisance to Mahakaccayana, but
            some bhikkhus thought that Sakka was being partial to Mahakaccayana. To them, the Buddha said, "One who is
            restrained in his senses is loved by both men and devas.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 94: The arahat whose sense-faculties are calm like horses well-tamed by the charioteer,
            who is free from pride and moral intoxicants - such an arahat is held dear even by the devas. </li>
          <li>The Story of Cincamanavika: At that instant, Sakka, king of the devas, became aware of the trouble being
            brewed at the Jetavana monastery, so he sent four of his devas in the form of young rats. The four rats got
            under the clothes of Cincamanavika and bit off the strings that fastened the wooden plank round her stomach.
            As the strings broke, the wooden plank dropped, cutting off the front part of her feet. Thus, the deception
            of Cincamanavika was uncovered, and many from the crowd cried out in anger, "Oh you wicked woman! A liar and
            a cheat! How dare you accuse our noble Teacher!" Some of them spat on her and drove her out. She ran as fast
            as she could, and when she had gone some distance the earth cracked and fissured and she was swallowed up.

            The next day, while the bhikkhus were talking about Cincamanavika, the Buddha came to them and said.
            "Bhikkhu;, one who is not afraid to tell lies, and who does not care what happens in the future existence,
            will not hesitate to do any evil."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 181: The wise who practise jhana concentration and Insight Meditation take delight in the
            peace of liberation from sensual pleasures and moral defilements. Such wise and mindful ones, who truly
            comprehend the Four Noble Truths (i.e., Arahats and Buddhas) are held dear also by the devas. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 200: Indeed we live very happily, without any anxiety (i.e., without greed, ill will and
            ignorance); like the Abhassara brahmas we shall live on delightful satisfaction (piti) as our food.</li>
          <li>The Story of Sakka: The bhikkhus were surprised and awe-struck to find Sakka himself attending on the
            Buddha. When the Buddha heard their remarks he said, "Bhikkhus! There is nothing surprising about Sakka's
            love and devotion to me. Once, when the former Sakka was growing old and was about to pass away, he came to
            see me. Then, I expounded the Dhamma to him. While listening to the Dhamma, he attained Sotapatti Fruition;
            then he passed away and was reborn as the present Sakka. All these happened to him simply because he
            listened to the Dhamma expounded by me. Indeed, bhikkhus, it is good to see the Noble Ones (ariyas); it is a
            pleasure to live with them; to live with fools is, indeed, painful."</li>
          <li>The Story of Licchavi Princes: On one festival day, the Buddha entered the town of Vesali, accompanied by
            a retinue of bhikkhus. On their way, they met some Licchavi princes, who had come out elegantly dressed up.
            The Buddha seeing them in full regalia said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus, those who have not been to the
            Tavatimsa deva world should have a good look at these Licchavi princes." The princes were then on their way
            to a pleasure garden. There, they quarrelled over a prostitute and soon came to blows. As a result, some of
            them had to be carried home, bleeding. As the Buddha returned with the bhikkhus after his meal in the town,
            they saw the wounded princes being carried home.
            In connection with the above incident the bhikkhus remarked, "For the sake of a woman, these Licchavi
            princes are ruined." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, sorrow and fear arise out of enjoyment of
            sensual pleasures and attachment to them."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Boys: Later, when the bhikkhus remarked that the boys were very partial to Thera
            Kassapa, the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus, all bhikkhus who are like my son Kassapa are liked by both
            devas and men. Such bhikkhus always receive ample offerings of the four requisites of bhikkhus."</li>
          <li>The Story of Kisagotami: Sakka seeing her, asked the Buddha who the lady was, and the Buddha replied, "O
            Sakka! She is my daughter Kisagotami. Once, she came to me in sorrow and distress through the loss of her
            son and I made her see the impermanent, the unsatisfactory and the non-self nature of all conditioned
            things. As a consequence of that she attained Sotapatti Fruition, joined the Order, and became an arahat.
            She is one of my eminent female disciples and is matchless in the ascetic practice of wearing robes made
            from rags collected from a dust heap."</li>

And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

          <li>Exodus 14-19, 20: And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</li>
          <li>Exodus 14-24, ..., 27: And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</li>

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</li>
          <li>Exodus 22-28, 29: Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people. Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</li>
          <li>Exodus 23-20, 21: Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.</li>

And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side: Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick. And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers. And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.

          <li>Quran 2-30: ˹Remember˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive ˹human˺
            authority on earth.” They asked ˹Allah˺, “Will You place in it someone who will spread corruption there and
            shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do
            not know.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 2-34: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,”1 so they all did—but not Iblîs,2 who refused and acted arrogantly,3 becoming unfaithful. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-102: They ˹instead˺ followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon. Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils disbelieved. They taught magic to the people, along with what had been revealed to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, in Babylon.1 The two angels never taught anyone without saying, “We are only a test ˹for you˺, so do not abandon ˹your˺ faith.” Yet people learned ˹magic˺ that caused a rift ˹even˺ between husband and wife; although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah’s Will. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed was the price for which they sold their souls, if only they knew! </li>
          <li>Quran 2-248: Their prophet further told them, “The sign of Saul’s kingship is that the Ark will come to you—containing reassurance1 from your Lord and relics of the family of Moses and the family of Aaron,2 which will be carried by the angels. Surely in this is a sign for you, if you ˹truly˺ believe.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-80: And he would never ask you to take angels and prophets as lords. Would he ask you to disbelieve after you have submitted? </li>
          <li>Quran 3-124, 125: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when you said to the believers, “Is it not enough that your Lord will send down a reinforcement of three thousand angels for your aid?” Most certainly, if you ˹believers˺ are firm and mindful ˹of Allah˺ and the enemy launches a sudden attack on you, Allah will reinforce you with five thousand angels designated ˹for battle˺.  </li>
          <li>Quran 6-61: He reigns supreme over all of His creation, and sends recording-angels, watching over you. When death comes to any of you, Our angels take their soul, never neglecting this duty. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-93: Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or claims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to them—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of Allah’s revelations!”? If you ˹O Prophet˺ could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands ˹saying˺, “Give up your souls! Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for telling lies about Allah and for being arrogant towards His revelations!” </li>
          <li>Quran 6-111: Even if We had sent them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and assembled before their own eyes every sign ˹they demanded˺, they still would not have believed—unless Allah so willed. But most of them are ignorant ˹of this˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-158: Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or some of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive, belief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no good through their faith.1 Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-27: O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your parents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to expose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who disbelieve. </li>
          <li>Qruan 7-206: Surely those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-9: ˹Remember˺ when you cried out to your Lord for help, He answered, “I will reinforce you with a thousand angels—followed by many others.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 8-12: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when your Lord revealed to the angels, “I am with you. So make the believers stand firm. I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-50: If only you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers, beating their faces and backs, ˹saying,˺ “Taste the torment of burning! </li>
          <li>Quran 9-26: Then Allah sent down His reassurance1 upon His Messenger and the believers, and sent down forces2 you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such was the reward of the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-70: And when he saw that their hands did not reach for the food, he became suspicious and fearful of them.1 They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not be afraid! We are ˹angels˺ sent ˹only˺ against the people of Lot.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-81, 82, 83: The angels said, “O Lot! We are the messengers of your Lord. They will never reach you. So travel with your family in the dark of night, and do not let any of you look back, except your wife. She will certainly suffer the fate of the others.1 Their appointed time is the morning. Is the morning not near?”  When Our command came, We turned the cities upside down and rained down on them clustered stones of baked clay, marked by your Lord ˹O Prophet˺. And these stones are not far from the ˹pagan˺ wrongdoers!</li>
          <li>Quran 11-94, 95: When Our command came, We saved Shu’aib and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook the wrongdoers, so they fell lifeless in their homes, as if they had never lived there. So away with Midian as it was with Thamûd! </li>
          <li>Quran 13-11: For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by Allah’s command. Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺. And if it is Allah’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him. 
          <li>Quran 13-13: The thunder glorifies His praises, as do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking with them whoever He wills. Yet they dispute about Allah. And He is tremendous in might. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44: ˹Remember, O  Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from sounding clay moulded from black mud.1 So when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺ breathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.” So the angels prostrated all together—  but not Iblîs,1 who refused to prostrate with the others. Allah asked, “O Iblîs! What is the matter with you that you did not join others in prostration?” He replied, “It is not for me to prostrate to a human You created from sounding clay moulded from black mud.” Allah commanded, “Then get out of Paradise, for you are truly cursed. And surely upon you is condemnation until the Day of Judgment.” Satan appealed, “My Lord! Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.” Allah said, “You will be delayed until the appointed Day.” Satan responded, “My Lord! For allowing me to stray I will surely tempt them on earth and mislead them all together, except Your chosen servants among them.”  Allah said, “This is the Way, binding on Me: you will certainly have no authority over My servants, except the deviant who follow you, and surely Hell is their destined place, all together. It has seven gates, to each a group of them is designated.” </li> 
          <li>Quran 16-2: He sends down the angels with revelation by His command to whoever He wills of His servants, ˹stating:˺ “Warn ˹humanity˺ that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me, so be mindful of Me ˹alone˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-28: Those whose souls the angels seize while they wrong themselves will then offer ˹full˺ submission ˹and say falsely,˺ “We did not do any evil.” ˹The angels will say,˺ “No! Surely Allah fully knows what you used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-32: those whose souls the angels take while they are virtuous, saying ˹to them˺, “Peace be upon you! Enter Paradise for what you used to do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-61: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,1 who protested, “Should I prostrate to the one You have created from mud?”
          <li>Quran 19-16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21: And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Mary when she withdrew from her family to a place in the east, screening herself off from them. Then We sent to her Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺ appearing before her as a man, perfectly formed. She appealed, “I truly seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you! ˹So leave me alone˺ if you are God-fearing.” He responded, “I am only a messenger from your Lord, ˹sent˺ to bless you with a pure son.” She wondered, “How can I have a son when no man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?” He replied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me. And so will We make him a sign for humanity and a mercy from Us.’ It is a matter ˹already˺ decreed.” </li>
          <li>Quran 19-22, 23, 24, 25, 26: So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place.  Then the pains of labour drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She cried, “Alas! I wish I had died before this, and was a thing long forgotten!” So a voice1 reassured her from below her, “Do not grieve! Your Lord has provided a stream at your feet. And shake the trunk of this palm tree towards you, it will drop fresh, ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink, and put your heart at ease. But if you see any of the people, say, ‘I have vowed silence1 to the Most Compassionate, so I am not talking to anyone today.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-26, 27, 28: And they say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring!”1 Glory be to Him! In fact, those ˹angels˺ are only ˹His˺ honoured servants,  who do not speak until He has spoken, ˹only˺ acting at His command. He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them. They do not intercede except for whom He approves, and they tremble in awe of Him. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-91: And ˹remember˺ the one who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her through Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺1 making her and her son a sign for all peoples. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-75:  Allah selects messengers from both angels and people, for Allah is truly All-Hearing, All-Seeing. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-60: And so they pursued them at sunrise. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-192, ..., 195: This is certainly a revelation from the Lord of all worlds,  which the trustworthy spirit ˹Gabriel˺ brought down  into your heart ˹O Prophet˺—so that you may be one of the warners—  in a clear Arabic tongue.</li>
          <li>Quran 27-38, ..., 41:  Solomon asked, “O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in ˹full˺ submission?”1  One mighty jinn responded, “I can bring it to you before you rise from this council of yours. And I am quite strong and trustworthy for this ˹task˺.” But the one who had knowledge of the Scripture said,1 “I can bring it to you in the blink of an eye.” So when Solomon saw it placed before him, he exclaimed, “This is by the grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. But whoever is ungrateful, surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”  ˹Then˺ Solomon said, “Disguise her throne for her so we may see whether she will recognize ˹it˺ or she will not be able to.” </li>
          <li>Quran 32-11: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Your soul will be taken by the Angel of Death, who is in charge of you. Then to your Lord you will ˹all˺ be returned.” </li>
          <li>Quran 33-9: Oh believers! Remember Allah’s favour upon you when ˹enemy˺ forces came to ˹besiege˺ you ˹in Medina˺, so We sent against them a ˹bitter˺ wind and forces you could not see.2 And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-43: He is the One Who showers His blessings upon you—and His angels pray for you—so that He may bring you out of darkness and into light. For He is ever Merciful to the believers.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-56: Indeed, Allah showers His blessings upon the Prophet, and His angels pray for him. O  believers! Invoke Allah’s blessings upon him, and salute him with worthy greetings of peace.</li>
          <li>Quran 34-12: And to Solomon ˹We subjected˺ the wind: its morning stride was a month’s journey and so was its evening stride. And We caused a stream of molten copper to flow for him, and ˹We subjected˺ some of the jinn to work under him by his Lord’s Will. And whoever of them deviated from Our command, We made them taste the torment of the blaze. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-13: They made for him whatever he desired of sanctuaries, statues,1 basins as large as reservoirs, and cooking pots fixed ˹into the ground˺. ˹We ordered:˺ “Work gratefully, O  family of David!” ˹Only˺ a few of My servants are ˹truly˺ grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-14: When We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing indicated to the ˹subjected˺ jinn that he was dead except the termites eating away his staff.1 So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if they had ˹really˺ known the unseen, they would not have remained in ˹such˺ humiliating servitude. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-20: Indeed, Iblîs’ assumption about them has come true,1 so they ˹all˺ follow him, except a group of ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-23: No intercession will be of any benefit with Him, except by those granted permission by Him. ˹At last,˺ when the dread ˹of Judgment Day˺ is relieved from their hearts ˹because they are permitted to intercede˺, they will ˹excitedly˺ ask ˹the angels˺, “What has your Lord ˹just˺ said?” The angels will reply, “The truth! And He is the Most High, All-Great.” </li>
          <li>Quran 34-40, 41: And ˹consider˺ the Day He will gather them all together, and then ask the angels, “Was it you that these ˹polytheists˺ used to worship?” They will say, “Glory be to You! Our loyalty is to You, not them. In fact, they ˹only˺ followed the ˹temptations of evil˺ jinn,1 in whom most of them had faith.” </li>
          <li>Quran 35-1: All praise is for Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made angels ˹as His˺ messengers with wings—two, three, or four. He increases in creation whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 36-26, ..., 29: ˹But they killed him, then˺ he was told ˹by the angels˺, “Enter Paradise!” He said, “If only my people knew of how my Lord has forgiven me, and made me one of the honourable.” We did not send any soldiers from the heavens against his people after his death, nor did We need to. All it took was one ˹mighty˺ blast, and they were extinguished at once. </li>
          <li>Quran 36-48, ..., 53:  And they ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?” They must be awaiting a single Blast,1 which will seize them while they are ˹entrenched˺ in ˹worldly˺ disputes. Then they will not be able to make a ˹last˺ will, nor can they return to their own people. The Trumpet will be blown ˹a second time˺, then—behold!—they will rush from the graves to their Lord. They will cry, “Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of rest? This must be what the Most Compassionate warned us of; the messengers told the truth!” It will only take one Blast, then at once they will all be brought before Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 37-22, ..., 34: ˹Allah will say to the angels,˺ “Gather ˹all˺ the wrongdoers along with their peers, and whatever they used to worship instead of Allah, then lead them ˹all˺ to the path of Hell. And detain them, for they must be questioned.” ˹Then they will be asked,˺ “What is the matter with you that you can no longer help each other?” In fact, on that Day they will be ˹fully˺ submissive. They will turn on each other, throwing blame. The misled will say, “It was you who deluded us away from what is right.”1The misleaders will reply, “No! You disbelieved on your own. We had no authority over you. In fact, you yourselves were a transgressing people. The decree of our Lord has come to pass against us ˹all˺: we will certainly taste ˹the punishment˺.  We caused you to deviate, for we ourselves were deviant.” Surely on that Day they will ˹all˺ share in the punishment. That is certainly how We deal with the wicked. </li>
          <li>Quran 37-158: They have also established a ˹marital˺ relationship between Him and the jinn. Yet the jinn ˹themselves˺ know well that such people will certainly be brought ˹for punishment˺.1</li>
          <li>Quran 37-164, 165, 166: ˹The angels respond,˺ “There is not one of us without an assigned station ˹of worship˺. We are indeed the ones lined up in ranks ˹for Allah˺. And we are indeed the ones ˹constantly˺ glorifying ˹His praise˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 38-21, ..., 24: Has the story of the two plaintiffs, who scaled the ˹wall of David’s˺ sanctuary, reached you ˹O Prophet˺? When they came into David’s presence, he was startled by them. They said, “Have no fear. ˹We are merely˺ two in a dispute: one of us has wronged the other. So judge between us with truth—do not go beyond ˹it˺—and guide us to the right way. This is my brother.1 He has ninety-nine sheep while I have ˹only˺ one. ˹Still˺ he asked me to give it up to him, overwhelming me with ˹his˺ argument.” David ˹eventually˺ ruled, “He has definitely wronged you in demanding ˹to add˺ your sheep to his. And certainly many partners wrong each other, except those who believe and do good—but how few are they!” Then David realized that We had tested him so he asked for his Lord’s forgiveness, fell down in prostration, and turned ˹to Him in repentance˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 38-71, ..., 85: ˹Remember, O  Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from clay. So when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺ breathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.”  So the angels prostrated all together— but not Iblîs,1 who acted arrogantly,2 becoming unfaithful. Allah asked, “O Iblîs! What prevented you from prostrating to what I created with My Own Hands? Did you ˹just˺ become proud? Or have you always been arrogant?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.” Allah commanded, “Then get out of Paradise, for you are truly cursed. And surely upon you is My condemnation until the Day of Judgment.” Satan appealed, “My Lord! Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.” Allah said, “You will be delayed until the appointed Day.” Satan said, “By Your Glory! I will certainly mislead them all, except Your chosen servants among them.” Allah concluded, “The truth is—and I ˹only˺ say the truth—: I will surely fill up Hell with you and whoever follows you from among them, all together.” </li>
          <li>Quran 39-75: You will see the angels all around the Throne, glorifying the praises of their Lord, for judgment will have been passed on all with fairness. And it will be said,1 “Praise be to Allah—Lord of all worlds!” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-49, 50: And those in the Fire will cry out to the keepers of Hell,1 “Pray to your Lord to lighten the torment for us ˹even˺ for one day!” The keepers will reply, “Did your messengers not ˹constantly˺ come to you with clear proofs?” They will say, “Yes ˹they did˺.” The keepers will say, “Then pray! Though the prayer of the disbelievers is only in vain.” </li>
          <li>Quran 41-13: If they turn away, then say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I warn you of a ˹mighty˺ blast, like the one that befell ’Ȃd and Thamûd.” </li>
          <li>Quran 41-25: We placed at their disposal ˹evil˺ associates who made their past and future ˹misdeeds˺ appealing to them.1 ˹So˺ the fate of earlier communities of jinn and humans has been justified against them ˹as well˺, ˹for˺ they were truly losers. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-30, 31: Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast, the angels descend upon them,1 ˹saying,˺ “Do not fear, nor grieve. Rather, rejoice in the good news of Paradise, which you have been promised. We are your supporters in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. There you will have whatever your souls desire, and there you will have whatever you ask for: </li>
          <li>Quran 41-38: But if the pagans are too proud, then ˹let them know that˺ those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord glorify Him day and night, and never grow weary. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-29: And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all living beings He dispersed throughout both. And He is Most Capable of bringing all together whenever He wills. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-60: Had We willed, We could have easily replaced you ˹all˺ with angels,1 succeeding one another on earth. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-61: And his ˹second˺ coming is truly a sign for the Hour. So have no doubt about it, and follow me. This is the Straight Path. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-29: This record of Ours speaks the truth about you. Indeed, We always had your deeds recorded ˹by the angels˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 46-18: These are the ones against whom the fate of earlier communities of jinn and humans has been justified, ˹for˺ they were truly losers. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-25: It destroyed everything by the command of its Lord, leaving nothing visible except their ruins. This is how We reward the wicked people. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-29, ..., 32: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when We sent a group of jinn your way to listen to the Quran. Then, upon hearing it, they said ˹to one another˺, “Listen quietly!” Then when it was over, they returned to their fellow jinn as warners. They declared, “O our fellow jinn! We have truly heard a scripture revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it. It guides to the truth and the Straight Way. O  our fellow jinn! Respond to the caller of Allah and believe in him, He will forgive your sins and protect you from a painful punishment. And whoever does not respond to the caller of Allah will have no escape on earth, nor will they have any protectors against Him. It is they who are clearly astray.” </li>
          <li>Quran 47-19: So, know ˹well, O  Prophet,˺ that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Allah. And seek forgiveness for your shortcomings1 and for ˹the sins of˺ the believing men and women. For Allah ˹fully˺ knows your movements and places of rest ˹O people˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 47-27: Then how ˹horrible˺ will it be when the angels take their souls, beating their faces and backs! </li>
          <li>Quran 48-1, 2, 3: Indeed, We have granted you a clear triumph ˹O Prophet˺1 so that Allah may forgive you for your past and future shortcomings,1 perfect His favour upon you, guide you along the Straight Path, and so that Allah will help you tremendously. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-9, 10, 11: And We send down blessed rain from the sky, bringing forth gardens and grains for harvest, and towering palm trees ˹loaded˺ with clustered fruit, ˹as˺ a provision for ˹Our˺ servants. And with this ˹rain˺ We revive a lifeless land. Similar is the emergence ˹from the graves˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-16, 17, 18: Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ created humankind and ˹fully˺ know what their souls whisper to them, and We are closer to them than ˹their˺ jugular vein. As the two recording-angels—˹one˺ sitting to the right, and ˹the other to˺ the left—note ˹everything˺, not a word does a person utter without having a ˹vigilant˺ observer ready ˹to write it down˺.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 50-38: Indeed, We created the heavens and the earth and everything in between in six Days,1 and We were not ˹even˺ touched with fatigue.2</li>
          <li>Quran 51-4: and ˹the angels˺ administering affairs by ˹Allah’s˺ command! </li>
          <li>Quran 51-28: ˹They did not eat,˺ so he grew fearful of them.1 They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not be afraid,” and gave him good news of a knowledgeable son.2</li>
          <li>Quran 51-31, ..., 34: ˹Later,˺ Abraham asked, “What is your mission, O  messengers?” They replied, “We have actually been sent to a wicked people, to send upon them stones of ˹baked˺ clay, marked by your Lord for the transgressors.” </li>
          <li>Quran 51-41, 42:  And in ˹the story of˺ ’Âd ˹was another lesson,˺ when We sent against them the devastating wind.1 There was nothing it came upon that it did not reduce to ashes. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-43, 44, 45: And in ˹the story of˺ Thamûd ˹was another lesson,˺ when they were told, “Enjoy yourselves ˹only˺ for a ˹short˺ while.”1 Still they persisted in defying the commands of their Lord, so they were overtaken by a ˹mighty˺ blast while they were looking on. Then they were not able to rise up, nor were they helped. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-56: I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me. </li>
          <li>Quran 52-20: They will be reclining on thrones, ˹neatly˺ lined up ˹facing each other˺. And We will pair them to maidens with gorgeous eyes. </li>
          <li>Quran 53-5, ..., 11: He has been taught by one ˹angel˺ of mighty power1 and great perfection, who once rose to ˹his˺ true form1 while on the highest point above the horizon, then he approached ˹the Prophet˺, coming so close that he was only two arms-lengths away or even less.1 Then Allah revealed to His servant what He revealed ˹through Gabriel˺. The ˹Prophet’s˺ heart did not doubt what he saw. </li>
          <li>Quran 53-26: ˹Imagine˺ how many ˹noble˺ angels are in the heavens! ˹Even˺ their intercession would be of no benefit whatsoever, until Allah gives permission to whoever He wills and ˹only for the people He˺ approves. </li>
          <li>Quran 55-31: We will soon attend to you ˹for judgment˺, O  two multitudes ˹of jinn and humans˺! </li>
          <li>Quran 66-12: ˹There is˺ also ˹the example of˺ Mary, the daughter of ’Imrân, who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her ˹womb˺ through Our angel ˹Gabriel˺.1 She testified to the words of her Lord and His Scriptures, and was one of the ˹sincerely˺ devout. </li>
          <li>Quran 69-16, 17: The sky will then be so torn that it will be frail,  with the angels on its sides. On that Day eight ˹mighty angels˺ will bear the Throne of your Lord above them. </li>
          <li>Quran 70-3, 4: from Allah, Lord of pathways of ˹heavenly˺ ascent, ˹through which˺ the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit1 will ascend to Him on a Day fifty thousand years in length.2  So endure ˹this denial, O  Prophet,˺ with beautiful patience. </li> 
          <li>Quran 72-1, ..., 12: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn listened ˹to the Quran,˺ and said ˹to their fellow jinn˺: ‘Indeed, we have heard a wondrous recitation. It leads to Right Guidance so we believed in it, and we will never associate anyone with our Lord ˹in worship˺. ˹Now, we believe that˺ our Lord—Exalted is His Majesty—has neither taken a mate nor offspring, and that the foolish of us used to utter ˹outrageous˺ falsehoods about Allah.1 We certainly thought that humans and jinn would never speak lies about Allah. And some men used to seek refuge with some jinn—so they increased each other in wickedness.1 And those ˹humans˺ thought, just like you ˹jinn˺, that Allah would not resurrect anyone ˹for judgment˺. ˹Earlier˺ we tried to reach heaven ˹for news˺, only to find it filled with stern guards and shooting stars.1 We used to take up positions there for eavesdropping, but whoever dares eavesdrop now will find a flare lying in wait for them.  Now, we have no clue whether evil is intended for those on earth, or their Lord intends for them what is right.  Among us are those who are righteous and those who are less so. We have been of different factions. ˹Now,˺ we truly know that we cannot frustrate Allah on earth, nor can we escape from Him ˹into heaven˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 72-14: And among us are those who have submitted ˹to Allah˺ and those who are deviant. So ˹as for˺ those who submitted, it is they who have attained Right Guidance. </li>
          <li>Quran 77-1, ..., 6: By those ˹winds˺ sent forth successively, and those blowing violently, and those blowing violently, And ˹by˺ those ˹angels˺ fully distinguishing ˹truth from falsehood˺, and those delivering revelation, ending excuses and giving warnings. </li>
          <li>Quran 78-38: on the Day the ˹holy˺ spirit1 and the angels will stand in ranks. None will talk, except those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are true. </li>
          <li>Quran 79-1, ..., 5: By those ˹angels˺ stripping out ˹evil souls˺ harshly, and those pulling out ˹good souls˺ gently, and those gliding ˹through heavens˺ swiftly, and those taking the lead vigorously, and those conducting affairs ˹obediently˺! </li> 
          <li>Quran 82-10, ..., 12: while you are certainly observed by vigilant, honourable angels, recording ˹everything˺. They know whatever you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 86-4: There is no soul without a vigilant angel ˹recording everything˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 89-21, ..., 26: Enough! When the earth is entirely crushed over and over,  and your Lord comes ˹to judge˺ with angels, rank upon rank, and Hell is brought forth on that Day—this is when every ˹disbelieving˺ person will remember ˹their own sins˺. But what is the use of remembering then? They will cry, “I wish I had sent forth ˹something good˺ for my ˹true˺ life.”  On that Day He will punish ˹them˺ severely, like no other,  and bind ˹them˺ tightly, like no other.1  </li>

There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.</li>
          <li>Genesis 50-22, ..., 26: And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</li>

          <li>Exodus 5-20, ..., 23: And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

          <li>Quran 4-102: When you ˹O Prophet˺ are ˹campaigning˺ with them and you lead them in prayer, let one group of them pray with you—while armed. When they prostrate themselves, let the other group stand guard behind them. Then the group that has not yet prayed will then join you in prayer—and let them be vigilant and armed.1 The disbelievers would wish to see you neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch a sweeping assault on you. But there is no blame if you lay aside your weapons when overcome by heavy rain or illness—but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-189: He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-80: ˹It does not matter˺ whether you ˹O Prophet˺ pray for them to be forgiven or not. Even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will never forgive them. That is because they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the rebellious people. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-61: And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. He ˹is the One Who˺ produced you from the earth and settled you on it. So seek His forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is Ever Near, All-Responsive ˹to prayers˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-40, 41, 42, 43: My Lord! Make me and those ˹believers˺ of my descendants keep up prayer. Our Lord! Accept my prayers. Our Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and the believers on the Day when the judgment will come to pass.” Do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them until a Day when ˹their˺ eyes will stare in horror—  rushing forth, heads raised, never blinking, hearts void. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-78, 79, 80, 81: Observe the prayer from the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and the dawn prayer, for certainly the dawn prayer is witnessed ˹by angels˺.1  And rise at ˹the last˺ part of the night, offering additional prayers, so your Lord may raise you to a station of praise.1 And say, “My Lord! Grant me an honourable entrance and an honourable exit1 and give me a supporting authority from Yourself.” And declare, “The truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood is bound to vanish.” </li>

Uplift my heart for me, and make my task easy, and remove the impediment from my tongue so people may understand my speech,1 and grant me a helper from my family,  Aaron, my brother.

          <li>Quran 25-65, 66: ˹They are˺ those who pray, “Our Lord! Keep the punishment of Hell away from us, for its punishment is indeed unrelenting. It is certainly an evil place to settle and reside.” </li>

Forgive me, my parents, and whoever enters my house in faith, and ˹all˺ believing men and women. And increase the wrongdoers only in destruction.” </li>

          <li>Quran 73-20: Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for nearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do some of those with you. Allah ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day and night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy.1 So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to Allah a good loan.2 Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah far better and more rewarding.3 And seek Allah’s forgiveness. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>

            polisher was reborn in niraya; the wife of the gem polisher was reborn in one of the deva worlds; and the

            When the subsidiary ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the state, as a rule
            the cases will be few in which they do not lose their power in three generations. (C.A. quote 702) </li>

            Genesis 40-8: And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
          </li>
          <li>Genesis 40-16, ..., 19: When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</li>
          <li>Genesis 40-20, ..., 23: And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
          <li>Exodus 12-26, ..., 28: And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</li>

          <li>Quran 3-21,22: Indeed, those who deny Allah’s signs, kill the prophets unjustly, and kill people who stand up for justice—give them good news of a painful punishment.  They are the ones whose deeds are wasted in this world and the Hereafter. And they will have no helpers. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-68: Had it not been for a prior decree from Allah,1 you would have certainly been disciplined with a tremendous punishment for whatever ˹ransom˺ you have taken. 
          <li>Quran 18-47, 48, 49: ˹Beware of˺ the Day We will blow the mountains away, and you will see the earth laid bare. And We will gather all ˹humankind˺, leaving none behind. They will be presented before your Lord in rows, ˹and the deniers will be told,˺ “You have surely returned to Us ˹all alone˺ as We created you the first time, although you ˹always˺ claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.” And the record ˹of deeds˺ will be laid ˹open˺, and you will see the wicked in fear of what is ˹written˺ in it. They will cry, “Woe to us! What kind of record is this that does not leave any sin, small or large, unlisted?” They will find whatever they did present ˹before them˺. And your Lord will never wrong anyone.</li>
          <li>Quran 20-105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113: And ˹if˺ they ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the mountains, ˹then˺ say, “My Lord will wipe them out completely, leaving the earth level and bare,  with neither depressions nor elevations to be seen.” On that Day all will follow the caller ˹for assembly˺, ˹and˺ none will dare to deviate. All voices will be hushed before the Most Compassionate. Only whispers1 will be heard. On that Day no intercession will be of any benefit, except by those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are agreeable to Him.  He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them,1 but they cannot encompass Him in ˹their˺ knowledge.2  And all faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. And those burdened with wrongdoing will be in loss.  But whoever does good and is a believer will have no fear of being wronged or denied ˹their reward˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-1, 2: O humanity! Fear your Lord, for the ˹violent˺ quaking at the Hour is surely a dreadful thing. The Day you see it, every nursing mother will abandon what she is nursing, and every pregnant woman will deliver her burden ˹prematurely˺. And you will see people ˹as if they were˺ drunk, though they will not be drunk; but the torment of Allah is ˹terribly˺ severe. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-11: This ˹Quran˺ is ˹true˺ guidance. And those who deny their Lord’s revelations will suffer the ˹worst˺ torment of agonizing pain. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-43, 44, 45: It is certainly We Who give life and cause death. And to Us is the final return.  ˹Beware of˺ the Day the earth will split open, letting them rush forth. That will be an easy gathering for Us. We know best what they say. And you ˹O Prophet˺ are not ˹there˺ to compel them ˹to believe˺. So remind with the Quran ˹only˺ those who fear My warning. </li>
          <li>Quran 67-27: Then when they see the torment drawing near, the faces of the disbelievers will become gloomy, and it will be said ˹to them˺, “This is what you claimed would never come.”1  </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 153: I, who have been seeking the builder of this house (body), failing to attain
            Enlightenment (Bodhi nana or Sabbannuta nana) which would enable me to find him, have wandered through
            innumerable births in samsara. To be born again and again is, indeed, dukkha!

            Verse 154: Oh house-builder! You are seen, you shall build no house (for me) again. All your rafters are
            broken, your roof-tree is destroyed. My mind has reached the unconditioned (i.e., Nibbana); the end of
            craving (Arahatta Phala) has been attained.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Three Daughters of Mara: The Buddha did not accept nor did he refuse the offer, but
            first, he related to the brahmin how the daughters of Mara tempted him soon after his attainment of
            Buddhahood. To the beautiful Tanha, Arati and Raga, the daughters of Mara, the Buddha had said, "It is no
            use tempting one who is free from craving, clinging and passion, for he cannot be lured by any temptation
            whatsoever."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Buddha's Return from the Tavatimsa Deva World: As promised, the Buddha came with the six
            coloured rays shining forth from his body to the city-gate of Sankassanagara, on the night of the full moon
            day of the month of Assayuja when the moon was shining brightly. He was accompanied by a large following of
            devas on one side and a large following of brahmas on the other. A large gathering headed by Thera Sariputta
            welcomed the Buddha back to this world; and the whole town was lit up. Thera Sariputta was awed by the
            grandeur and glory of the whole scene of the Buddha's return. He respectfully approached the Buddha and
            said, "Venerable Sir! We have never seen or even heard of such magnificent and resplendent glory. Indeed,
            Venerable Sir, you are loved, respected and revered alike by devas, brahmas and men!" To him the Buddha
            said, "My son Sariputta, the Buddhas who are endowed with unique qualities are truly loved by men and devas
            alike</li>
          <li>The Story of the Buddha's Former Deeds: On learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said to them,
            "Bhikkhus, that I have been revered so much by brahmas, devas and human beings alike and that they have made
            offerings on such a grand and lavish scale to me on this occasion is not due to the power I now possess; it
            is simply because I had done some small meritorious deeds in one of my previous existences that I now enjoy
            such great benefits".</li>
          <li>The Story of Upaka: When Upaka saw Gotama Buddha, he was very much impressed by the radiant countenance of
            the Buddha and so said to him, "Friend, you look so serene and pure; may I know who your teacher is?" To
            him, the Buddha replied that he had no teacher.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Ananda: Seeing the Buddha in his glory and splendour, the Venerable Ananda immediately
            approached the Buddha and burst forth, "O Venerable Sir! The light that shines forth from your noble body
            far surpasses the light from the king, the light from the thera, the light from the sun and the light from
            the moon."</li>

            A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, "May we not say that you Master is a sage? How various is his
            ability!" (C.A quote 302) Tsze-kung said, "Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a
            sage.
            And moreover, his ability is various" (C.A. quote 303)</li>

          <li>Ch'an Tsze-ch'in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, "You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be
            superior
            to you?" (C.A. quote 833) Tsze-kung said to him, "For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for
            one
            word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. (C.A. quote 834) Our
            Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a
            stair." (C.A. quote 835)</li>
          <li>Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find
            verified
            the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would
            be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and
            forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be
            harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it
            possible for him to be attained to?" (C.A. quote 836)</li>
          <li>Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, "Let me use the comparison of a house
            and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever
            is
            valuable in the apartments. (C.A. quote 829)
            The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see
            the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. (C.A. quote 830) But I
            may
            assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been
            expected?" (C.A. quote 831)</li>

            Genesis 24-7: The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

          <li>Genesis 41-25, ..., 37: And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</li>
          <li>Genesis 41-56, 57: And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.</li>
          <li>Genesis 45-1, ..., 28: Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours. And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</li>
          <li>Genesis 49-1, ..., 28: And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD. Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last. Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties. Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words. Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</li>
          <li>Genesis 50-8, ..., 12: And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</li>
          <li>Exodus 4-1, ..., 4: And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee. And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</li>
          <li>Exodus 4-6, ..., 9: And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</li>
          <li>Exodus 7-14, ..., 25: And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</li>
          <li>Exodus 8-1, ..., 7: And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.</li>
          <li>Exodus 9-7, ..., 12: And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.
          <li>Exodus 9-22, ..., 26: And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
          <li>Exodus 14-21, 22, 23: And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</li>
          <li>Exodus 15-19, ..., 21: For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</li>

            Quran 11-31: I do not say to you that I possess Allah’s treasuries or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel, nor do I say that Allah will never grant goodness to those you look down upon. Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ within them. ˹If I did,˺ then I would truly be one of the wrongdoers.”

          <li>Quran 12-93, 96: Go with this shirt of mine and cast it over my father’s face, and he will regain his sight. Then come back to me with your whole family.” But when the bearer of the good news arrived, he cast the shirt over Jacob’s face, so he regained his sight. Jacob then said ˹to his children˺, “Did I not tell you that I truly know from Allah what you do not know?” </li>

I lean on it, and with it I beat down ˹branches˺ for my sheep, and have other uses for it.”1  Allah said, “Throw it down, O  Moses!”  So he did, then—behold!—it became a serpent, slithering.  Allah said, “Take it, and have no fear. We will return it to its former state.  And put your hand under your armpit, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished,1 as another sign,  so that We may show you some of Our greatest signs.  Go to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-77, 78: And We surely inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants ˹at night˺ and strike a dry passage for them across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be concerned ˹of drowning˺.”  Then Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers—but how overwhelming were the waters that submerged them! </li>
          <li>Quran 21-81, 82: And to Solomon We subjected the raging winds, blowing by his command to the land We had showered with blessings. It is We Who know everything.  And ˹We subjected˺ some jinn1 that dived for him,2 and performed other duties. It is We Who kept them in check. </li>

          <li>Quran 33-55: There is no blame on the Prophet’s wives ˹if they appear unveiled˺ before their fathers,1 their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their fellow ˹Muslim˺ women, and those ˹bondspeople˺ in their possession. And be mindful of Allah ˹O wives of the Prophet!˺ Surely Allah is a Witness over all things.</li>
          <li>Quran 38-36, 37: So We subjected to him the wind, blowing gently at his command to wherever he pleased.  And ˹We subjected to him˺ every builder and diver1 of the jinn, </li>
          <li>Quran 49-7: And keep in mind that Allah’s Messenger is ˹still˺ in your midst. If he were to yield to you in many matters, you would surely suffer ˹the consequences˺.1 But Allah has endeared faith to you, making it appealing in your hearts. And He has made disbelief, rebelliousness, and disobedience detestable to you. Those are the ones rightly guided. </li>

So when he informed her of it, she exclaimed, “Who told you this?” He replied, “I was informed by the All-Knowing, All-Aware.” </li>

          <li>Quran 5-96: It is lawful for you to hunt and eat seafood, as a provision for you and for travellers. But hunting on land is forbidden to you while on pilgrimage. Be mindful of Allah to Whom you all will be gathered. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-119: Why should you not eat of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name when He has already explained to you what He has forbidden to you—except when compelled by necessity? Many ˹deviants˺ certainly mislead others by their whims out of ignorance. Surely your Lord knows the transgressors best. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-121: Do not eat of what is not slaughtered in Allah’s Name. For that would certainly be ˹an act of˺ disobedience. Surely the devils whisper to their ˹human˺ associates to argue with you.1 If you were to obey them, then you ˹too˺ would be polytheists. </li>

And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</li>

And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.</li>
          <li>Exodus 2-2, ..., 10: And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</li>
          <li>Exodus 2-1, ..., 4: Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.</li>
          <li>Exodus 4-18, ..., 24: And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</li>
          <li>Exodus 7-8, ..., 13: And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</li>
          <li>Exodus 11-8, 9, 10: And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.</li>
          <li>Exodus 12-29, ..., 39: And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.</li>
          <li>Exodus 17-4, 5, 6: And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</li>
          <li>Exodus 19-3, ..., 5: And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:</li>
          <li>Exodus 19-18, ..., 22: And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</li>
          <li>Exodus 31-18: And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.</li>
          <li>Exodus 33-19, ..., 23: And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.
          <li>Exodus 34-29, 30: And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.</li>
          <li>Exodus 40-34, 35: Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</li>
          <li>Leviticus 10-1, 2: And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-260: And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord! Show me how you give life to the dead.” Allah responded, “Do you not believe?” Abraham replied, “Yes I do, but just so my heart can be reassured.” Allah said, “Then bring four birds, train them to come to you, ˹then cut them into pieces,˺ and scatter them on different hilltops. Then call them back, they will fly to you in haste. And ˹so you will˺ know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-143: When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-40: ˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion,1 “Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-31: When she heard about their gossip,1 she invited them and set a banquet for them. She gave each one a knife, then said ˹to Joseph˺, “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they were so stunned ˹by his beauty˺ that they cut their hands,2 and exclaimed, “Good God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel!” </li>
          <li>Quran 19-10, 11: Zachariah said, “My Lord! Grant me a sign.” He responded, “Your sign is that you will not ˹be able to˺ speak to people for three nights, despite being healthy.” So he came out to his people from the sanctuary, signalling to them to glorify ˹Allah˺ morning and evening. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47: And surely We had shown You favour before, when We inspired your mother with this: ‘Put him into a chest, then put it into the river. The river will wash it ashore, and he will be taken by ˹Pharaoh,˺ an enemy of Mine and his.’ And I blessed you with lovability from Me1 ˹O Moses˺ so that you would be brought up under My ˹watchful˺ Eye. ˹Remember˺ when your sister came along and proposed, ‘Shall I direct you to someone who will nurse him?’1 So We reunited you with your mother so that her heart would be put at ease, and she would not grieve. ˹Later˺ you killed a man ˹by mistake˺, but We saved you from sorrow, as well as other tests We put you through. Then you stayed for a number of years among the people of Midian. Then you came here as pre-destined, O  Moses! And I have selected you for My service.  Go forth, you and your brother, with My signs and never falter in remembering Me. Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺.  Speak to him gently, so perhaps he may be mindful ˹of Me˺ or fearful ˹of My punishment˺.”  They both pleaded, “Our Lord! We fear that he may be quick to harm us or act tyrannically.”  Allah reassured ˹them˺, “Have no fear! I am with you, hearing and seeing.  So go to him and say, ‘Indeed we are both messengers from your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And salvation will be for whoever follows the ˹right˺ guidance. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76: They said, “O Moses! Either you cast, or let us be the first to cast.” Moses responded, “No, you go first.” And suddenly their ropes and staffs appeared to him—by their magic—to be slithering. So Moses concealed fear within himself. We reassured ˹him˺, “Do not fear! It is certainly you who will prevail. Cast what is in your right hand, and it will swallow up what they have made, for what they have made is no more than a magic trick. And magicians can never succeed wherever they go.” So the magicians fell down in prostration, declaring, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.” Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. You will really see whose punishment is more severe and more lasting.” They responded, “By the One Who created us! We will never prefer you over the clear proofs that have come to us. So do whatever you want! Your authority only covers the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world. Indeed, we have believed in our Lord so He may forgive our sins and that magic you have forced us to practice. And Allah is far superior ˹in reward˺ and more lasting ˹in punishment˺ Whoever comes to their Lord as an evildoer will certainly have Hell, where they can neither live nor die. But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done good, they will have the highest ranks: the Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, where they will stay forever. That is the reward of those who purify themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-116: They threatened, “If you do not desist, O  Noah, you will surely be stoned ˹to death˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 27-19: So Solomon smiled in amusement at her words, and prayed, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You have blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please you. Admit me, by Your mercy, into ˹the company of˺ Your righteous servants.” </li>
          <li>Quran 28-7, ..., 13: We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse him, but when you fear for him, put him then into the river, and do not fear or grieve. We will certainly return him to you, and make him one of the messengers.”  And ˹it so happened that˺ Pharaoh’s people picked him up, only to become their enemy and source of grief. Surely Pharaoh, Hamân, and their soldiers were sinful. Pharaoh’s wife said ˹to him˺, “˹This baby is˺ a source of joy for me and you. Do not kill him. Perhaps he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son.” They were unaware ˹of what was to come˺. And the heart of Moses’ mother ached so much that she almost gave away his identity, had We not reassured her heart in order for her to have faith ˹in Allah’s promise˺. And she said to his sister, “Keep track of him!” So she watched him from a distance, while they were unaware. And We had caused him to refuse all wet-nurses at first, so his sister suggested, “Shall I direct you to a family who will bring him up for you and take good care of him?” This is how We returned him to his mother so that her heart would be put at ease, and not grieve, and that she would know that Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true. But most people do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 28-15, ..., 42: ˹One day˺ he entered the city unnoticed by its people.1 There he found two men fighting: one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. The man from his people called to him for help against his foe. So Moses punched him, causing his death. Moses cried, “This is from Satan’s handiwork. He is certainly a sworn, misleading enemy.”  He pleaded, “My Lord! I have definitely wronged my soul, so forgive me.” So He forgave him, ˹for˺ He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  Moses pledged, “My Lord! For all Your favours upon me, I will never side with the wicked.”  And so Moses became fearful, watching out in the city, when suddenly the one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses rebuked him, “Indeed, you are clearly a trouble-maker.” Then when Moses was about to lay his hands on their foe,1 the enemy said, “O Moses! Do you intend to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land. You do not intend to make peace!” And there came a man, rushing from the farthest end of the city. He said, “O Moses! The chiefs are actually conspiring against you to put you to death, so leave ˹the city˺. I really advise you ˹to do so˺.”  So Moses left the city in a state of fear and caution, praying, “My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing people.”  And as he made his way towards Midian, he said, “I trust my Lord will guide me to the right way.” When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a group of people watering ˹their herds˺. Apart from them, he noticed two women holding back ˹their herd˺. He asked ˹them˺, “What is the problem?” They replied, “We cannot water ˹our animals˺ until the ˹other˺ shepherds are done, for our father is a very old man.” So he watered ˹their herd˺ for them, then withdrew to the shade and prayed, “My Lord! I am truly in ˹desperate˺ need of whatever provision You may have in store for me.”1   One of the two daughters suggested, “O my dear father! Hire him. The best man for employment is definitely the strong and trustworthy ˹one˺.” Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is inviting you so he may reward you for watering ˹our animals˺ for us.” When Moses came to him and told him his whole story, the old man said, “Have no fear! You are ˹now˺ safe from the wrongdoing people.” The old man proposed, “I wish to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you, provided that you stay in my service for eight years. If you complete ten, it will be ˹a favour˺ from you, but I do not wish to make it difficult for you. Allah willing, you will find me an agreeable man.” Moses responded, “˹Then˺ it is ˹settled˺ between you and I. Whichever term I fulfill, there will be no ˹further˺ obligation on me. And Allah is a Witness to what we say.” When Moses had completed the term and was travelling with his family, he spotted a fire on the side of Mount Ṭûr. He said to his family, “Stay here, ˹for˺ I have spotted a fire. Perhaps from there I can bring you some directions1 or a torch from the fire so you may warm yourselves.” But when he came to it, he was called from the bush in the sacred ground to the right side of the valley: “O Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah—the Lord of all worlds. Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹Allah reassured him,˺ “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear. You are perfectly secure. Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished.1 And cross your arms tightly to calm your fears.2 These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They have truly been a rebellious people.”  Moses appealed, “My Lord! I have indeed killed a man from them, so I fear they may kill me.  And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I, so send him with me as a helper to support what I say, for I truly fear they may reject me.” Allah responded, “We will assist you with your brother and grant you both authority, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and those who follow you will ˹certainly˺ prevail.” But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said ˹arrogantly˺, “This is nothing but conjured magic ˹tricks˺. We have never heard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers.” Moses responded, “My Lord knows best who has come with ˹true˺ guidance from Him and will fare best in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”  Pharaoh declared, “O chiefs! I know of no other god for you but myself. So bake bricks out of clay for me, O  Hamân, and build a high tower so I may look at the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.” And so he and his soldiers behaved arrogantly in the land with no right, thinking they would never be returned to Us. So We seized him and his soldiers, casting them into the sea. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers! We made them leaders inviting ˹others˺ to the Fire. And on the Day of Judgment they will not be helped.  We caused a curse to follow them in this world. And on the Day of Judgment they will be among the outcasts. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-23, 24:  Indeed, We sent Moses with Our signs and compelling proof  to Pharaoh, Hamân, and Korah. But they responded: “Magician! Total liar!” </li>
          <li>Quran 62-11: When they saw the fanfare along with the caravan, they ˹almost all˺ flocked to it, leaving you ˹O Prophet˺ standing ˹on the pulpit˺. Say, “What is with Allah is far better than amusement and merchandise. And Allah is the Best Provider.” </li>
          <li>Quran 72-19, ..., 23: Yet when the servant of Allah1 stood up calling upon Him ˹alone˺, the pagans almost swarmed over him. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I call only upon my Lord, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺.” Say, “It is not in my power to harm or benefit you.” Say, “No one can protect me from Allah ˹if I were to disobey Him˺, nor can I find any refuge other than Him. ˹My duty is˺ only to convey ˹the truth˺ from Allah and ˹deliver˺ His messages.” And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger will certainly be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there for ever and ever.  </li>
          <li>Quran 110-1, 2, 3: When Allah’s ˹ultimate˺ help comes and the victory ˹over Mecca is achieved˺,  and you ˹O Prophet˺ see the people embracing Allah’s Way in crowds, then glorify the praises of your Lord and seek His forgiveness, for certainly He is ever Accepting of Repentance. </li>

            Exodus 18-13, ..., 27: And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

            serious offence; it will send him to Avici Niraya. For a virtuous person, it is easy to do good deeds and
            difficult to do evil; but for an evil one, it is easy to do evil and difficult to do good deeds. Indeed, in
            life it is easy to do something which is not beneficial, but it is very difficult to do something which is
            good and beneficial."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 163: It is easy to do things that are bad and unbeneficial to oneself, but it is, indeed,
            most difficult to do things that are beneficial and good. /li>
          <li>The Story of the Defeat of the King of Kosala: The King of Kosala was ashamed and very much depressed over
            his defeat. Thus his lamentation: "What a disgrace! I cannot even conquer this boy who still smells of
            mother's milk. It is better that I should die." Feeling depressed and very much ashamed, the king refused to
            take food, and kept to his bed. The news about the king's distress spread like wild fire and when the Buddha
            came to learn about it, he said, "Bhikkhus! In one who conquers, enmity and hatred increase; one who is
            defeated suffers pain and distress."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 209: He who does what should not be done and fails to do what should be done, who
            forsakes the noble aim of life (i. e., Morality, Concentration and Insight) and grasps at sensual pleasure,
            covets the benefits gained by those who exert themselves (in meditation).
            Verse 210: Do not associate with those who are dear, and never with those who are not dear to you; not
            seeing the dear ones is painful, and seeing those who are not dear to you is also painful.
            Verse 211: Therefore, one should hold nothing dear; separation from the loved ones is painful; there are no
            fetters for those who do not love or hate.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 249: People give according to their faith and their devotion; one who is displeased with
            others receiving food and drink cannot attain concentration (samadhi) by day or by night.
            Verse 250: He who has this feeling of displeasure cut off, uprooted and removed, will surely attain
            concentration (samadhi) by day or by night.</li>
          <li>The Story of Mendaka the Rich Man: The Buddha then said, "My disciple, it is natural for people not to see
            one's own faults, and to exaggerate other people's faults and failings."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Followers of Non-Buddhist Doctrines: On hearing those disparaging remarks, the Buddha
            said, "Bhikkhus! There are some who keep silent because they are ignorant and timid, and some who keep
            silent because they do not want to share their profound knowledge with others. Only one who has overcome
            evil is to be called a muni."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 292: In those who leave undone what should indeed be done but do what should not be done,
            who are conceited and unmindful, moral intoxicants increase.
            Verse 293: In those who always make a good effort in meditating on the body, who do not do what should not
            be done but always do what should be done, who are also mindful and endowed with clear comprehension, moral
            intoxicants come to an end.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Elephant Called Paveyyaka: "There, he made the musicians strike up a martial tune.
            Hearing the military airs, the elephant felt as if he were in a battlefield; his spirits rose, he pulled
            himself with all his might, and was soon out of the mire."</li>

            Genesis 34-7, ..., 29: And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done. And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father. And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.

And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</li>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</li>

And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</li>

          <li>Quran 4-128: If a woman fears indifference or neglect from her husband, there is no blame on either of them if they seek ˹fair˺ settlement, which is best.

          <li>Quran 5-66: And had they observed the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have been overwhelmed with provisions from above and below. Some among them are upright, yet many do nothing but evil. </li>

And surely those who were made to inherit the Scripture3 after them are truly in alarming doubt about this ˹Quran</li>
          <li>Quran 45- 17: We ˹also˺ gave them clear commandments regarding ˹their˺ faith. But it was not until knowledge came to them that they differed out of mutual envy.1 Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences. </li>
          <li>Quran 57-26: And indeed, We sent Noah and Abraham and reserved prophethood and revelation for their descendants. Some of them are ˹rightly˺ guided, while most are rebellious. </li>

          <li>Quran 71-6: but my calls only made them run farther away. </li>
          <li>Quran 89-15, ..., 20: Now, whenever a human being is tested by their Lord through ˹His˺ generosity and blessings, they boast, “My Lord has ˹deservedly˺ honoured me!”  But when He tests them by limiting their provision, they protest, “My Lord has ˹undeservedly˺ humiliated me!”  Absolutely not! In fact, you are not ˹even˺ gracious to the orphan,  nor do you urge one another to feed the poor.  And you devour ˹others’˺ inheritance greedily,1  and love wealth fervently. </li>

            brahmins, taking advantage of this unusual feature, put him on a cart and took him round the town for
            exhibition and only those who paid a hundred or a thousand were allowed to touch him. On one occasion, they
            stopped at a place between the town and the Jetavana monastery. To ariyas going to the Jetavana monastery,
            they said, 'What is the use of your going to the Buddha and listening to his discourses? There is no one who
            is as powerful as Candabha. One who touches him will get rich; why don't you come and see ?" The ariyas then

          <li>Quran 2-212: The life of this world has been made appealing to the disbelievers, and they mock the believers. Those who are mindful ˹of Allah˺ will rank above them on the Day of Judgment. And Allah provides for whoever He wills without limit. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-14: The enjoyment of ˹worldly˺ desires—women, children,1 treasures of gold and silver, fine horses, cattle, and fertile land—has been made appealing to people. These are the pleasures of this worldly life, but with Allah is the finest destination. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-91: Indeed, if each of those who disbelieve then die as disbelievers were to offer a ransom of enough gold to fill the whole world, it would never be accepted from them. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-44: When they became oblivious to warnings, We showered them with everything they desired. But just as they became prideful of what they were given, We seized them by surprise, then they instantly fell into despair! </li>
          <li>Quran 8-6: They disputed with you about the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-24: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If your parents and children and siblings and spouses and extended family and the wealth you have acquired and the trade you fear will decline and the homes you cherish—˹if all these˺ are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and struggling in His Way, then wait until Allah brings about His Will. Allah does not guide the rebellious people.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-38: O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling firmly to ˹your˺ land?1 Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-58: There are some of them who are critical of your distribution of alms ˹O Prophet˺. If they are given some of it they are pleased, but if not they are enraged. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-7, 8:  Indeed, those who do not expect to meet Us, being pleased and content with this worldly life, and who are heedless of Our signs, they will have the Fire as a home because of what they have committed. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-15: Whoever desires ˹only˺ this worldly life and its luxuries, We will pay them in full for their deeds in this life—nothing will be left out. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-84: And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And do not give short measure and weight. I do see you in prosperity now, but I truly fear for you the torment of an overwhelming Day. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-116: If only there had been among the ˹destroyed˺ peoples before you, ˹O believers,˺ virtuous individuals who forbade corruption in the land—other than the few We had saved ˹from the torment˺. But the wrongdoers ˹only˺ pursued their ˹worldly˺ pleasures, becoming wicked. 
          <li>Quran 16-72: And Allah has made for you spouses of your own kind, and given you through your spouses children and grandchildren.1 And He has granted you good, lawful provisions. Are they then faithful to falsehood and ungrateful for Allah’s favours? </li>
          <li>Quran 16-112: And Allah sets forth the example of a society which was safe and at ease, receiving its provision in abundance from all directions. But its people met Allah’s favours with ingratitude, so Allah made them taste the clutches of hunger and fear for their misdeeds. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-117: ˹It is only˺ a brief enjoyment, then they will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-18: Whoever desires this fleeting world ˹alone˺, We hasten in it whatever We please to whoever We will; then We destine them for Hell, where they will burn, condemned and rejected. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-39, 40: If only you had said, upon entering your property, ‘This is what Allah has willed! There is no power except with Allah!’ Even though you see me inferior to you in wealth and offspring, perhaps my Lord will grant me ˹something˺ better than your garden, and send down upon your garden a thunderbolt from the sky, turning it into a barren waste. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-46: Wealth and children are the adornment of this worldly life, but the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in hope.1</li>
          <li>Quran 20-131: Do not let your eyes crave what We have allowed some of the disbelievers to enjoy; the ˹fleeting˺ splendour of this worldly life, which We test them with. But your Lord’s provision ˹in the Hereafter˺ is far better and more lasting. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-24: Or have they taken other gods besides Him? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof. Here is ˹the Quran,˺ the Reminder for those with me; along with ˹earlier Scriptures,˺ the Reminder for those before me.”1 But most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-52, 53, 54, 55, 56: Surely this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so fear Me ˹alone˺. Yet the people have divided it into different sects, each rejoicing in what they have. So leave them ˹O Prophet˺ in their heedlessness for a while. Do they think, since We provide them with wealth and children, that We hasten to ˹honour˺ them ˹with˺ all kinds of good? No! They are not aware. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-35, 36: But I will certainly send him a gift, and see what ˹response˺ my envoys will return with.”1 When the chief-envoy came to him, Solomon said, “Do you offer me wealth? What Allah has granted me is far greater than what He has granted you. No! It is you who rejoice in ˹receiving˺ gifts. </li>
          <li>Quran 28-58: ˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed that had been spoiled by their ˹comfortable˺ living! Those are their residences, never inhabited after them except passingly.1 And We ˹alone˺ were the Successor. </li>
          <li>Quran 28-60: Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is no more than ˹a fleeting˺ enjoyment and adornment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting. Will you not then understand? </li>
          <li>Quran 29-64: This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But the Hereafter is indeed the real life, if only they knew. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-45: Those ˹destroyed˺ before them denied as well—and these ˹Meccans˺ have not attained even one-tenth of what We had given their predecessors.1 Yet ˹when˺ they denied My messengers, how severe was My response! </li>
          <li>Quran 36-47: And when it is said to them, “Donate from what Allah has provided for you,” the disbelievers say to the believers, “Why should we feed those whom Allah could have fed if He wanted to? You are clearly astray!” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-12: ˹They will be told,˺ “˹No!˺ This is because when Allah alone was invoked, you ˹staunchly˺ disbelieved. But when others were associated with Him ˹in worship˺, you ˹readily˺ believed. So ˹Today˺ judgment belongs to Allah ˹alone˺—the Most High, All-Great.” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-39: O my people! This worldly life is only ˹a fleeting˺ enjoyment, whereas the Hereafter is truly the home of settlement. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-36: Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is ˹no more than a fleeting˺ enjoyment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord; </li>
          <li>Quran 43-35: and ornaments ˹of gold˺. Yet all this is no more than a ˹fleeting˺ enjoyment in this worldly life. ˹But˺ the Hereafter with your Lord is ˹only˺ for those mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-67: Close friends will be enemies to one another on that Day, except the righteous, </li>
          <li>Quran 43-86: ˹But˺ those ˹objects of worship˺ they invoke besides Him have no power to intercede, except those who testify to the truth knowingly.1</li>
          <li>Quran 45-10: Awaiting them is Hell. Their ˹worldly˺ gains will not be of any benefit to them whatsoever, nor will those protectors they have taken besides Allah. And they will suffer a tremendous punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-35: This is because you made a mockery of Allah’s revelations, and were deluded by ˹your˺ worldly life.” So ˹from˺ that Day ˹on˺ they will not be taken out of the Fire, nor will they be allowed to appease ˹their Lord˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-17: But some scold their parents, “Enough with you! Are you warning me that I will be brought forth ˹from the grave˺, while many generations had already perished before me ˹for good˺?” The parents cry to Allah for help, ˹and warn their child,˺ “Pity you. Have faith! Surely Allah’s promise is true.” But the deniers insist, “This is nothing but ancient fables.” </li>
          <li>Quran 46-20: ˹Watch for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. ˹They will be told,˺ “You ˹already˺ exhausted your ˹share of˺ pleasures during your worldly life, and ˹fully˺ enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for your rebelliousness.” </li>
          <li>Quran 46-22: They argued, “Have you come to turn us away from our gods? Bring us then whatever you threaten us with, if what you say is true.” </li>
          <li>Quran 47-12: Surely Allah will admit those who believe and do good into Gardens under which rivers flow. As for the disbelievers, they enjoy themselves and feed like cattle.1 But the Fire will be their home. </li>
          <li>Quran 47-14: Can those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear proof from their Lord be like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and ˹only˺ follow their desires? </li>
          <li>Quran 47-36: This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But if you are faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, He will grant you your ˹full˺ reward, and will not ask you ˹to donate all˺ your wealth. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-12: The truth is: you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families again. And that was made appealing in your hearts. You harboured evil thoughts ˹about Allah˺, and ˹so˺ became a doomed people.” </li>
          <li>Quran 57-20: Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury, mutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain that causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants dry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.</li>
          <li>Quran 63-9: O believers! Do not let your wealth or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. For whoever does so, it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers. </li>
          <li>Quran 67-20: Also, which ˹powerless˺ force will come to your help instead of the Most Compassionate? Indeed, the disbelievers are only ˹lost˺ in delusion. </li>
          <li>Quran 69-27, ..., 29: I wish death was the end! My wealth has not benefited me! My authority has been stripped from me.” </li>
          <li>Quran 75-20, 21: But no! In fact, you love this fleeting world,  and neglect the Hereafter. </li>
          <li>Quran 76-27: Surely those ˹pagans˺ love this fleeting world, ˹totally˺ neglecting a weighty Day ahead of them. </li>
          <li>Quran 77-46: “Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while, ˹for˺ you are truly wicked.”</li>
          <li>Quran 87-16, 17: But you ˹deniers only˺ prefer the life of this world, even though the Hereafter is far better and more lasting. </li>
          <li>Quran 92-8, ..., 11: And as for the one who is stingy, indifferent ˹to Allah˺,  and ˹staunchly˺ denies the finest reward,  We will facilitate for them the path of hardship.  And their wealth will be of no benefit to them when they tumble ˹into Hell˺. </li>    
          <li>Quran 95-1, ..., 6: By the fig and the olive ˹of Jerusalem˺, and Mount Sinai, and this secure city ˹of Mecca˺!1 Indeed, We created humans in the best form. But We will reduce them to the lowest of the low ˹in Hell˺, </li>
          <li>Quran 102-1, 2: Competition for more ˹gains˺ diverts you ˹from Allah˺, until you end up in ˹your˺ graves.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 102-8: Then, on that Day, you will definitely be questioned about ˹your worldly˺ pleasures. </li>

          <li>Quran 4-29: O believers! Do not devour one another’s wealth illegally, but rather trade by mutual consent. And do not kill ˹each other or˺ yourselves. Surely Allah is ever Merciful to you. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-32: And do not crave what Allah has given some of you over others. Men will be rewarded according to their deeds and women ˹equally˺ according to theirs. Rather, ask Allah for His bounties. Surely Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. </li>

      <h4>The prophets on attachment</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: Later, the Buddha was asked by the bhikkhus why he had told them to wait for seven
          days before sharing out the robes of Thera Tissa. To them the Buddha replied, "My sons, Tissa had his mind
          attached to this particular set of robes at the time of his death, and so he was reborn as a louse and stayed
          in the folds of the robes. When you all were preparing to share out the robes, Tissa the louse was very much
          in agony and was running about to and fro in the folds of the robes. If you had taken the robes at that time
          Tissa the louse would have felt very bitter against you and he would have to go to niraya. But now, Tissa has
          been reborn in the Tusita deva world, and that is why I have allowed you to take the robes. Indeed, bhikkhus,
          attachment is very dangerous; as rust corrodes iron from which it is formed, so also, attachment destroys one
          and sends one to niraya. A bhikkhu should not indulge too much in the use of the four requisites or be very
          much attached to them."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 334: In a man who is unmindful craving grows like a creeper. He runs from birth to birth,
          like a monkey seeking fruits in the forest.
          Verse 335: In this world, sorrow grows in one who is overwhelmed by this vile craving that clings to the
          senses, just as well-watered birana grass grows luxuriantly.
          Verse 336: In this world, sorrow falls away from one who overcomes this vile craving that is difficult to get
          rid of, just as water drops fall away from a lotus leaf.
          Verse 337: Therefore, I will deliver this worthy discourse to all of you who have assembled here. Dig up the
          root of craving just as one who wishes to have the fragrant root digs up the birana grass. Do not let Mara
          destroy you again and again, as the flood destroys the reed.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 338: Just as a tree with roots undamaged and firm grows again even though cut down, so
          also, if latent craving is not rooted out, this dukkha (of birth, ageing and death) arises again and again.
          Verse 339: That man of wrong views, in whom the thirty-six streams (of craving) that flow towards pleasurable
          objects are strong, is carried away by his many thoughts connected with passion.
          Verse 340: The stream of craving flows towards all sense objects; the creeper of craving arises (at the six
          sense-doors) and fixes itself (on the six sense objects). Seeing that creeper of craving growing, cut off its
          roots with Magga Insight.
          Verse 341: In beings, there flows happiness that is smeared with craving; those beings attached to pleasure
          and seeking pleasure are, indeed, subject to birth and ageing.
          Verse 342: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare; held fast by fetters and
          bonds they undergo dukkha (round of rebirths) again and again, for a long time.
          Verse 343: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare. Therefore, One who wishes to
          free himself from craving should eradicate craving.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 367: He who does not take the mind-and-body aggregate (nama-rupa) as "I and mine", and who
          does not grieve over the dissolution (of mind and body) is, indeed, called a bhikkhu.</li>
        <li>The Story of a Brahmin: When he told the Buddha about this, the Buddha replied to him, "O brahmin! I do not
          call him a brahmana just because he is born of brahmin parents. I call him a brahmana only if he is free from
          moral defilements and cut off all clinging to existence."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 404: Him I call a brahmana, who associates not with the householder or with the homeless
          one, or with both, who is free from sensual desire and has few wants.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Jatila: Some time afterwards, the bhikkhus asked Jatila whether he was still attached to
          his mound of gold and his sons, and he answered that he had no more attachment to them. The bhikkhus then said
          to the Buddha that Jatila was falsely claiming to have attained arahatship. To them the Buddha said,
          "Bhikkhus! Jatila has got rid of craving and pride; he has indeed attained arahatship."</li>

        <li>Genesis 30-31: And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:</li>
        <li>Genesis 31-22, ..., 29: And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</li>
        <li>Genesis 9-16, 17, 18: And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.

Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.</li>
        <li>Exodus 10-27, 28: But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</li>

          Quran 2-96: You will surely find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than polytheists. Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But even if they were to live that long, it would not save them from the punishment. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do. 
        </li>
        <li>Quran 2-170: When it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed, "they reply, "No! We only follow what we found our forefathers practicing." Would they still do so, even if their forefathers had absolutely no understanding or guidance?</li>
        <li>Quran 2-211: Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. And whoever trades Allah’s favour—after receiving it—˹for disbelief˺ should know that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.</li>
        <li>Quran 2-232: When you have divorced women and they have reached the end of their waiting period, do not prevent them from re-marrying their ex-husbands if they come to an honourable agreement. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. This is purer and more dignifying for you. Allah knows and you do not know. </li>
        <li>Quran 2-235: There is no blame on you for subtly showing interest in ˹divorced or widowed˺ women1 or for hiding ˹the intention˺ in your hearts. Allah knows that you are considering them ˹for marriage˺. But do not make a secret commitment with them—you can only show interest in them appropriately. Do not commit to the bond of marriage until the waiting period expires. Know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-176: ˹O Prophet!˺ Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—surely they will not harm Allah in the least. It is Allah’s Will to disallow them a share in the Hereafter, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-19: O believers! It is not permissible for you to inherit women against their will1 or mistreat them to make them return some of the dowry ˹as a ransom for divorce˺—unless they are found guilty of adultery.2 Treat them fairly. If you happen to dislike them, you may hate something which Allah turns into a great blessing. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-115: And whoever defies the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will let them pursue what they have chosen, then burn them in Hell—what an evil end! </li>
        <li>Quran 5-26: Allah replied, “Then this land is forbidden to them for forty years, during which they will wander through the land. So do not grieve for the rebellious people.” </li>
        <li>Quran 5-41: O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-93: He turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to disbelieve?” </li>
        <li>Quran 9-93: Blame is only on those who seek exemption from you although they have the means. They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and Allah has sealed their hearts so they do not realize ˹the consequences˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-37: And build the Ark under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes and directions, and do not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they will surely be drowned.” </li>
        <li>Quran 11-87: They asked ˹sarcastically˺, “O Shu’aib! Does your prayer command you that we should abandon what our forefathers worshipped or give up managing our wealth as we please? Indeed, you are such a tolerant, sensible man!” </li>
        <li>Quran 11-91: They threatened, “O Shu’aib! We do not comprehend much of what you say, and surely we see you powerless among us. Were it not for your clan, we would have certainly stoned you, for you are nothing to us.” </li>

But most of them do not know ˹this favour˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 29-38: And the people of ’Ȃd and Thamûd ˹met a similar fate˺, which must be clear to you ˹Meccans˺ from their ruins.1 Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way, although they were capable of reasoning. </li>

        <li>Quran 34-43, 44: When Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say, “This is only a man who wishes to hinder you from what your forefathers used to worship.” They also say, “This ˹Quran˺ is no more than a fabricated lie.” And the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is nothing but pure magic.” ˹They say so even though˺ We had never given them any scriptures to study, nor did We ever send them a warner before you ˹O Prophet˺. </li>

        <li>Quran 40-34: Joseph already came to you1 earlier with clear proofs, yet you never ceased to doubt what he came to you with. When he died you said, ‘Allah will never send a messenger after him.’ This is how Allah leaves every transgressor and doubter to stray— </li>
        <li>Quran 41-14: The messengers had come to them from all angles, ˹proclaiming,˺ “Worship none but Allah.” They responded, “Had our Lord willed, He could have easily sent down angels ˹instead˺. So we totally reject what you have been sent with.” </li>
        <li>Quran 42-10: ˹Say to the believers, O  Prophet,˺ “Whatever you may differ about, its judgment rests with Allah. That is Allah—my Lord. In Him I put my trust, and to Him I ˹always˺ turn.” </li>

        <li>Quran 54-39: ˹Again they were told,˺ “Taste now My punishment and warnings!” </li>
        <li>Quran 60-3: Neither your relatives nor children will benefit you on Judgment Day—He will decide between you ˹all˺. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>
        <li>Quran 64-6: That was because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they said ˹mockingly˺, “How can humans be our guides?” So they persisted in disbelief and turned away. And Allah was not in need ˹of their faith˺. For Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. </li>
        <li>Quran 64-12: Obey Allah and obey the Messenger! But if you turn away, then Our Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly. </li>
        <li>Quran 65-6: Let them live where you live ˹during their waiting period˺, according to your means. And do not harass them to make their stay unbearable. If they are pregnant, then maintain them until they deliver. And if they nurse your child,1 compensate them, and consult together courteously. But if you fail to reach an agreement, then another woman will nurse ˹the child˺ for the father. </li>

          <li>The Story of the Companions of Visakha: On arrival at the monastery, they drank all the liquor they had
            brought and threw away the bottles. Visakha requested the Buddha to teach them the Dhamma. By that time, the
            women were getting intoxicated and felt like singing and dancing. Mara, taking this opportunity made them
            bold and shameless, and soon they were boisterously singing, dancing, clapping and jumping about in the
            monastery. The Buddha saw the hand of Mara in the shameless behaviour of these women and said to himself,
            "Mara must not be given the opportunity." So, the Buddha sent forth dark-blue rays from his body and the
            whole room was darkened; the women were frightened and began to get sober. Then, the Buddha vanished from
            his seat and stood on top of Mount Meru, and from there he sent forth white rays and the sky was lit up as
            if by a thousand moons. After thus manifesting his powers, the Buddha said to those five hundred women, "You
            ladies should not have come to my monastery in this unmindful state. Because you have been negligent Mara
            has had the opportunity to make you behave shamelessly, laughing and singing loudly, in my monastery. Now,
            strive to put out the fire of passion (raga) which is in you".</li>
          <li>The Story of a Brahmin Who Had Great Faith: To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, if you don't feel any
            false pride and undue elation when addressed as arahats, you are not guilty of breaking any of the rules of
            discipline of the bhikkhus. The fact is that the brahmin addressed you so because he was extremely devoted
            to the arahats. So. my sons, you should strive hard to get rid of craving and attain arahatship."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 389: One should not strike a brahmana; a brahmana should not get angry with his
            assailant; it is shameful to strike a brahmana; it is more shameful to get angry with one's assailant.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master said, "When good government prevails in a state, to be
            thinking
            only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-this
            is

          <li>Genesis 49-3, ..., 7: Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

You lust after men instead of women! You are certainly transgressors.” But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel them from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!” So We saved him and his family except his wife, who was one of the doomed. We poured upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. See what was the end of the wicked! </li>
          <li>Quran 23-39, 40, 41: The messenger prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied ˹me˺.”  Allah responded, “Soon they will be truly regretful.”  Then the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook them with justice, and We reduced them to rubble. So away with the wrongdoing people! </li>
          <li>Quran 32-12: If only you could see the wicked hanging their heads ˹in shame˺ before their Lord, ˹crying:˺ “Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back and we will do good. We truly have sure faith ˹now˺!” </li>

            outside the house about the time the thera usually came on his alms-round. This gave her the excuse that it
            was very dusty and noisy on the ground floor; with this excuse she invited the thera to the top floor to
            have his alms-food. The thera consented and went up and as soon as he had entered the room, the courtesan
            closed the door. Then she started seducing the thera. She said to the thera, "Venerable Sir! Please be my
            youthful and energetic husband, and I will be your dearly beloved wife. After our long and happy wedded life
            we can both leave it to enter the Order and strive our very best to attain Nibbana." When he heard these

            Moggallana, and could not understand why such a personage like Thera Maha Moggallana should die at the hands
            of assassins. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! Considering that Moggallana had lived a noble life in this
            existence, he should not have met with such a death. But in one of his past existences, he had done a great
            wrong to his own parents, who were both blind. In the beginning, he was a very dutiful son, but after his
            marriage, his wife began to make trouble and she suggested that he should get rid of his parents. He took
            his blind parents in a cart into a forest, and there he killed them by beating them and making them believe
            that it was some thief who was beating them. For that evil deed he suffered in niraya for a long time; and

            replied, "Bhikkhus! If you judge from the good deeds he has done in this existence, he has indeed met with a
            death he does not deserve. But the fact is that he has only paid for the evil he had done in a past
            existence. In one of his previous existences, when he was a courtier in the palace of the king, he fell in
            love with another man's wife and had beaten her husband to death. Thus, evil deeds surely get one into

          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Other bhikkhus who were staying with him at the Jetavana monastery
            misinterpreted his actions and said to the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! The Venerable Sariputta still worships
            the various directions, viz., the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir and the Zenith, as he has
            done before as a brahmin youth; it seems as if he has not yet given up his old beliefs." The Buddha sent for
            the Venerable Sariputta and Sariputta explained to the Buddha that he was only paying obeisance to his
            teacher, the Venerable Assaji, and that he was not worshipping the various directions. </li>

          <li>Quran 2-111, 112: The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise except those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof if what you say is true.” But no! Whoever submits themselves to Allah and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-167: The misled followers will cry, "If only we could have a second chance, we would disown them as they disowned us." And so Allah will make them remorseful of their misdeeds. And they will never be able to leave the Fire.</li>

They will never frustrate Allah on earth, and they will have no protector besides Allah. Their punishment will be multiplied, for they failed to hear or see ˹the truth˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-33: Is ˹there any equal to˺ the Vigilant One Who knows what every soul commits? Yet the pagans have associated others with Allah ˹in worship˺. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Name them! Or do you ˹mean to˺ inform Him of something He does not know on the earth? Or are these ˹gods˺ just empty words?” In fact, the disbelievers’ falsehood has been made so appealing to them that they have been turned away from the Path. And whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide. </li>

And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

          <li>Quran 5-104: When it is said to them, “Come to Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” they reply, “What we found our forefathers practicing is good enough for us.” ˹Would they still do so,˺ even if their forefathers had absolutely no knowledge or guidance? </li>
          <li>Quran 6-74: And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said to his father, Ȃzar, “Do you take idols as gods? It is clear to me that you and your people are entirely misguided.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-28: Whenever they commit a shameful deed,1 they say, “We found our forefathers doing it and Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “No! Allah never commands what is shameful. How can you attribute to Allah what you do not know?” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-30: The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” while the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” Such are their baseless assertions, only parroting the words of earlier disbelievers. May Allah condemn them! How can they be deluded ˹from the truth˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 10-36: Most of them follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions. ˹And˺ surely assumptions can in no way replace the truth. Allah is indeed All-Knowing of what they do. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-62: They argued, “O Ṣâliḥ! We truly had high hopes in you before this.1 How dare you forbid us to worship what our forefathers had worshipped? We are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-109: So do not be in doubt ˹O Prophet˺ about what those ˹pagans˺ worship. They worship nothing except what their forefathers worshipped before ˹them˺. And We will certainly give them their share ˹of punishment˺ in full, without any reduction. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-40: Whatever ˹idols˺ you worship instead of Him are mere names which you and your forefathers have made up1—a practice Allah has never authorized. It is only Allah Who decides. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the upright faith, but most people do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-10: Their messengers asked ˹them˺, “Is there any doubt about Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He is inviting you in order to forgive your sins, and delay your end until your appointed term.”1 They argued, “You are no more than humans like us! You ˹only˺ wish to turn us away from what our forefathers worshipped. So bring us some compelling proof.” </li>
          <li>Quran 19-42: ˹Remember˺ when he said to his father, “O dear father! Why do you worship what can neither hear nor see, nor benefit you at all? </li>
          <li>Quran 21-52, 53, 54, 56, 57 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77:  ˹Remember˺ when he questioned his father and his people, “What are these statues to which you are so devoted?”  They replied, “We found our forefathers worshipping them.”  He responded, “Indeed, you and your forefathers have been clearly astray.”  They asked, “Have you come to us with the truth, or is this a joke?”  He replied, “In fact, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who created them ˹both˺. And to that I bear witness.”  ˹Then he said to himself,˺ “By Allah! I will surely plot against your idols after you have turned your backs and gone away.”  So he smashed them into pieces, except the biggest of them, so they might turn to it ˹for answers˺.  They protested, “Who dared do this to our gods? It must be an evildoer!”  Some said, “We heard a young man, called Abraham, speaking ˹ill˺ of them.”  They demanded, “Bring him before the eyes of the people, so that they may witness ˹his trial˺.”  They asked, “Was it you who did this to our gods, O  Abraham?”  He replied ˹sarcastically˺, “No, this one—the biggest of them—did it! So ask them, if they can talk!”  So they came back to their senses, saying ˹to one another˺, “You yourselves are truly the wrongdoers!”  Then they ˹quickly˺ regressed to their ˹original˺ mind-set, ˹arguing,˺ “You already know that those ˹idols˺ cannot talk.”  He rebuked ˹them˺, “Do you then worship—instead of Allah—what can neither benefit nor harm you in any way?  Shame on you and whatever you worship instead of Allah! Do you not have any sense?”  They concluded, “Burn him up to avenge your gods, if you must act.”  We ordered, “O fire! Be cool and safe for Abraham!”1  They had sought to harm him, but We made them the worst losers.  Then We delivered him, along with Lot, to the land We had showered with blessings for all people.1  And We blessed him with Isaac ˹as a son˺ and Jacob ˹as a grandson˺, as an additional favour—making all of them righteous. We ˹also˺ made them leaders, guiding by Our command, and inspired them to do good deeds, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. And they were devoted to Our worship. And to Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and delivered him from the society engrossed in shameful practices. They were certainly an evil, rebellious people.  And We admitted him into Our mercy, ˹for˺ he was truly one of the righteous.  And ˹remember˺ when Noah had cried out to Us earlier, so We responded to him and delivered him and his family1 from the great distress.  And We made him prevail over those who had rejected Our signs. They were truly an evil people, so We drowned them all. </li>
          <li>Quran 28-71:  Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you sunlight? Will you not then listen?” Ask ˹them also˺, “Imagine if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest in? Will you not then see?” </li>
          <li>Quran 31-22: When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “No! We ˹only˺ follow what we found our forefathers practicing.” ˹Would they still do so˺ even if Satan is inviting them to the torment of the Blaze? </li>
          <li>Quran 43-22, 23: In fact, they say, “We found our forefathers following a ˹particular˺ way, and we are following in their footsteps.” Similarly, whenever We sent a warner to a society before you ˹O Prophet˺, its ˹spoiled˺ elite would say, “We found our forefathers following a ˹particular˺ way, and we are walking in their footsteps.” </li>
          <li>Quran 53-23: These ˹idols˺ are mere names that you and your forefathers have made up1—a practice Allah has never authorized. They follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions and whatever ˹their˺ souls desire, although ˹true˺ guidance has already come to them from their Lord. </li>

          <li>I have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be
            few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubled with
            fears
            of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose (state of rest, sleep, and
            tranquility) among the people in their several places. For when the people keep their several places,
            there
            will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a
            contented repose, there will be no rebellious uspettings (C.A. quote 698)</li>
          <li>So it is.-Therefore, if remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and
            virtue
            are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made
            contented and tranquil (C.A. quote 699)
            Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. Remoter people are not submissive, and with your
            help, he cannot attract them to him. In his own terrirotry there are divisions and downfalls, leavings and
            separations, and, with your help, he cannot preserve it (C.A. quote 700) And yet he is planning these
            hostile movements within the state. -I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun family will not be on

          <li>Tsze-chang then asked, "What are meant by the four bad things?" The Master said, "To put the people to
            death without having instructed them;-this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full
            tale
            of work, without having given them warning;-this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without
            urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;-this is called injury. And,
            generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-this is called acting the part
            of
            a mere official." (C.A. quote 848)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked Confucius saying, "In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may
            conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the
            four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang said, "What are meant by the five
            excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without the great
            expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining (feel or express discontent; fret);
            when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being
            proud; when he is majestic without being fierce." (C.A. quote 846) Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by
            being
            beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more
            beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent
            without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who
            will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of
            covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not
            dare
            to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his
            clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with
            awe;-is
            not this to be majestic without being fierce?" (C.A. quote 848)</li>

          <li>Quran 4-97, 98, 99: When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves1—scolding them, “What do you think you were doing?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination! Except helpless men, women, and children who cannot afford a way out— it is right to hope that Allah will pardon them. For Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-116: ˹O Prophet!˺ If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would lead you away from Allah’s Way. They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-32: Ask, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions Allah has brought forth for His servants?” Say, “They are for the enjoyment of the believers in this worldly life, but they will be exclusively theirs on the Day of Judgment.1 This is how We make Our revelations clear for people of knowledge.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-56: Do not spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. And call upon Him with hope and fear. Indeed, Allah’s mercy is always close to the good-doers. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-86: And do not lie in ambush on every road—threatening and hindering those who believe in Allah from His Path and striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. And consider the fate of the corruptors! </li>
          <li>Quran 9-107: There are also those ˹hypocrites˺ who set up a mosque ˹only˺ to cause harm, promote disbelief, divide the believers, and as a base for those who had previously fought against Allah and His Messenger.1 They will definitely swear, “We intended nothing but good,” but Allah bears witness that they are surely liars. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-13, 14, 15, 16, 17: The disbelievers then threatened their messengers, “We will certainly expel you from our land, unless you return to our faith.” So their Lord revealed to them, “We will surely destroy the wrongdoers, and make you reside in the land after them. This is for whoever is in awe of standing before Me and fears My warning.”  And both sides called for judgment, so every stubborn tyrant was doomed. Awaiting them is Hell, and they will be left to drink oozing pus which they will sip with difficulty, and can hardly swallow. Death will overwhelm them from every side, yet they will not ˹be able to˺ die. Awaiting them still is harsher torment</li>
          <li>Quran 14-28, 29, 30:  Have you not seen those ˹disbelievers˺ who meet Allah’s favours with ingratitude and lead their own people to their doom? In Hell they will burn. What an evil place for settlement. They set up equals to Allah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy yourselves! Surely your destination is the Fire.” </li>

          <li>Quran 23-71: Had the truth followed their desires,1 the heavens, the earth, and all those in them would have certainly been corrupted. In fact, We have brought them ˹the means to˺ their glory, but they turn away from it. </li>

          <li>Quran 29-39: ˹We˺ also ˹destroyed˺ Korah, Pharaoh, and Hamân. Indeed, Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they behaved arrogantly in the land. Yet they could not escape ˹Us˺. </li>

          <li>The Story of Thera Kala: He approached the Buddha respectfully, and said, "Venerable Sir! This woman is
            very dull; she will not be able to understand the sublime Dhamma; please teach her only about charity (dana)
            and morality (sila)."

            The Buddha knew very well that Thera Kala was talking out of spite and with an ulterior motive. So he said
            to Thera Kala, "Bhikkhu! Because you are foolish and because of your wrong view, you scorn my Teaching. You
            yourself are your own ruin; in fact, you are only trying to destroy yourself."</li>

          <li>Genesis 31-14, 15: And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.</li>
          <li>Genesis 31-19, 20, 21: And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.</li>
          <li>Genesis 31-30, ..., 43: And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</li>
          <li>Genesis 1-22: And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</li>

          <li>Exodus 5-4, ..., 9: And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</li>
          <li>Exodus 5-13, ..., 19: And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw. And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.</li>

          <li>Quran 7-77: Then they killed the she-camel—defying their Lord’s command—and challenged ˹Ṣâliḥ˺, “Bring us what you threaten us with, if you are ˹truly˺ one of the messengers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-88: The arrogant chiefs of his people threatened, “O Shu’aib! We will certainly expel you and your fellow believers from our land, unless you return to our faith.” He replied, “Even if we hate it? </li>
          <li>Quran 7-127:  The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people protested, “Are you going to leave Moses and his people free to spread corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?” He responded, “We will kill their sons and keep their women.1 We will completely dominate them.” </li>
          <li>Quran 26-18, 19, 20, 21, 22: Pharaoh protested, “Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you stayed several years of your life in our care?  Then you did what you did,1 being ˹utterly˺ ungrateful!” Moses replied, “I did it then, lacking guidance.  So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me one of the messengers.  How can that be a ‘favour,’ of which you remind me, when ˹it was only because˺ you ˹have˺ enslaved the Children of Israel?” </li>
          <li>Quran 26-23, .., 52: Pharaoh asked, “And what is ‘the Lord of all worlds’?” Moses replied, “˹He is˺ the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, if only you had sure faith.” Pharaoh said to those around him, “Did you hear ˹what he said˺?” Moses added, “˹He is˺ your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.” Pharaoh said ˹mockingly˺, “Your messenger, who has been sent to you, must be insane.” Moses responded: “˹He is˺ the Lord of the east and west, and everything in between, if only you had any sense.” Pharaoh threatened, “If you take any other god besides me, I will certainly have you imprisoned.” Moses responded, “Even if I bring you a clear proof?” Pharaoh demanded, “Bring it then, if what you say is true.” So he threw down his staff and—behold!—it became a real snake. Then he drew his hand ˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for all to see. Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him, “He is indeed a skilled magician, who seeks to drive you from your land by his magic. So what do you propose?” They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and dispatch mobilizers to all cities to bring you every skilled magician.” So the magicians were assembled at the set time on the appointed day. And the people were asked, “Will you join the gathering, so that we may follow the magicians if they prevail?” When the magicians came, they asked Pharaoh, “Shall we have a ˹suitable˺ reward if we prevail?” He replied, “Yes, and you will then certainly be among those closest to me.” Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you wish to cast.” So they cast down their ropes and staffs, saying, “By Pharaoh’s might, it is we who will surely prevail.” Then Moses threw down his staff, and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion! So the magicians fell down, prostrating. They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—  the Lord of Moses and Aaron.” Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic, but soon you will see. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”  They responded, “˹That would be˺ no harm! Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return. We really hope that our Lord will forgive our sins, as we are the first to believe.” And We inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for you will surely be pursued.” </li>
          <li>Quran 28-83: That ˹eternal˺ Home in the Hereafter We reserve ˹only˺ for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-25, 26: Then, when he came to them with the truth from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those who believe with him and keep their women.” But the plotting of the disbelievers was only in vain.  And Pharaoh said, “Let me kill Moses, and let him call upon his Lord! I truly fear that he may change your traditions or cause mischief in the land.” </li>
          <li>Quran 40-35: those who dispute Allah’s signs with no proof given to them. How despicable is that for Allah and the believers! This is how Allah seals the heart of every arrogant tyrant.” </li>
          <li>Quran 41-15: As for ’Ȃd, they acted arrogantly throughout the land with no right, boasting, “Who is superior to us in might?” Did they not see that Allah ˹Himself˺, Who created them, was far superior to them in might? Still they persisted in denying Our signs. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-26: The disbelievers advised ˹one another˺, “Do not listen to this Quran but drown it out so that you may prevail.” </li>
          <li>Quran 43-17: Whenever one of them is given the good news of what they attribute to the Most Compassionate,1 his face grows gloomy, as he suppresses his rage. </li>
          <li>Quran 44-30, ..., 33: And We certainly delivered the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment  of Pharaoh. He was truly a tyrant, a transgressor.  And indeed, We chose the Israelites knowingly above the others.  And We showed them signs in which there was a clear test. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-39, 40: but Pharaoh was carried away by his power, saying ˹of Moses˺, “A magician or a madman!” So We seized him and his soldiers, casting them into the sea while he was blameworthy.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 79-21, ..., 26: but he denied and disobeyed ˹Allah˺, then turned his back, striving ˹against the truth˺. Then he summoned ˹his people˺ and called out, saying, “I am your lord, the most high!”  So Allah overtook him, making him an example in this life and the next. Surely in this is a lesson for whoever stands in awe of ˹Allah˺</li>

            to stop them. All alone, he went to them by going through the sky, and stopped immediately above the middle
            of the river. His relatives seeing him, powerfully and yet peacefully sitting above them in the sky, hid
            aside all their weapons and paid obeisance to the Buddha. Then, the Buddha said to them, "For the sake of
            some water, which is of little value, you should not destroy your lives which are of so much value and
            priceless. Why have you taken this stupid action? If I had not stopped you today, your blood would have been
            flowing like a river by now. You live hating your enemies, but I have none to hate; you are ailing with

            a bhikkhu. Only he who lives meditating on the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and insubstantiality of the

          <li>Quran 2-247: Their prophet told them, “Allah has appointed Saul1 to be your king.” They protested, “How can he be our king when some of us are more deserving of kingship than he, and he has not been blessed with vast riches?” He replied, “Allah has chosen him over you and blessed him with knowledge and stature. Allah grants kingship to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-24: This is because they say, “The Fire will not touch us except for a few days.” They have been deceived in their faith by their wishful lying. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-156: O believers! Do not be like the unfaithful1 who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” Allah makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is Allah who gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-168: Those who sat at home, saying about their brothers, “Had they listened to us, they would not have been killed.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Try not to die1 if what you say is true!” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-178: Those who disbelieve should not think that living longer is good for them. They are only given more time to increase in sin, and they will suffer a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-185: Every soul will taste death. And you will only receive your full reward on the Day of Judgment. Whoever is spared from the Fire and is admitted into Paradise will ˹indeed˺ triumph, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-196: Do not be deceived by the prosperity of the disbelievers throughout the land. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-141: ˹The hypocrites are˺ those who wait to see what happens to you. So if Allah grants you victory, they say ˹to you˺, “Were we not on your side?” But if the disbelievers have a share ˹of victory˺, they say ˹to them˺, “Did we not have the advantage over you, yet we protected you from the believers?” Allah will judge between ˹all of˺ you on the Day of Judgment. And Allah will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-100: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Good and evil are not equal, though you may be dazzled by the abundance of evil. So be mindful of Allah, O  people of reason, so you may be successful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 6-137: Likewise, the pagans’ evil associates have made it appealing to them to kill their own children—only leading to their destruction as well as confusion in their faith. Had it been Allah’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their falsehood. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-30: He has guided some, while others are destined to stray. They have taken devils as their masters instead of Allah—thinking they are ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-25: Indeed Allah has given you ˹believers˺ victory on many battlefields, even at the Battle of Ḥunain1 when you took pride in your great numbers, but they proved of no advantage to you. The earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on you, then you turned back in retreat. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-55: So let neither their wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this worldly life, then their souls will depart while they are disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-107: Do they feel secure that an overwhelming torment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not take them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 17-76: They were about to intimidate you to drive you out of the land ˹of Mecca˺, but then they would not have survived after you ˹had left˺ except for a little while. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-104, 105: ˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!” It is they who reject the signs of their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We will not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-89: Did they not see that it did not respond to them, nor could it protect or benefit them? </li>
          <li>Quran 10-18: They worship besides Allah others who can neither harm nor benefit them, and say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Are you informing Allah of something He does not know in the heavens or the earth? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺!” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-33: Are they only awaiting the coming of the angels or the command of your Lord ˹O Prophet˺? So were those before them. And Allah never wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-100: Say ˹to them, O  Prophet˺, “Even if you were to possess the ˹infinite˺ treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, then you would certainly withhold ˹them˺, fearing they would run out—for humankind is ever stingy!” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-12:  They call besides Allah what can neither harm nor benefit them. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can stray. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-39, 40: As for the disbelievers, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert, which the thirsty perceive as water, but when they approach it, they find it to be nothing. Instead, they find Allah there ˹in the Hereafter, ready˺ to settle their account. And Allah is swift in reckoning. Or ˹their deeds are˺ like the darkness in a deep sea, covered by waves upon waves,1 topped by ˹dark˺ clouds. Darkness upon darkness! If one stretches out their hand, they can hardly see it. And whoever Allah does not bless with light will have no light! </li>
          <li>Quran 24-50: Is there a sickness in their hearts? Or are they in doubt? Or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust to them? In fact, it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-3: Yet they have taken besides Him gods who cannot create anything but are themselves created. Nor can they protect or benefit themselves. Nor can they control life, death, or resurrection. </li>
          <li>Quran 28-78: He replied, “I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I have.”1 Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed some from the generations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater in accumulating ˹wealth˺? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins.2  </li>
          <li>Quran 34-35: Adding, “We are far superior ˹to the believers˺ in wealth and children, and we will never be punished.” </li>
          <li>Quran 35-40: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Have you considered your associate-gods which you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created on earth! Or do they have a share in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens? Or have We given the polytheists a Book, which serves as a clear proof for them? In fact, the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusion.” </li>
          <li>Quran 36-77, ..., 79: Do people not see that We have created them from a sperm-drop, then—behold!—they openly challenge ˹Us˺? And they argue with Us—forgetting they were created—saying, “Who will give life to decayed bones?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “They will be revived by the One Who produced them the first time, for He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of every created being. </li>
          <li>Quran 38-5: Has he reduced ˹all˺ the gods to One God? Indeed, this is something totally astonishing.” </li>
          <li>Quran 49-17: They regard their acceptance of Islam as a favour to you. Tell ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Do not regard your Islam as a favour to me. Rather, it is Allah Who has done you a favour by guiding you to the faith, if ˹indeed˺ you are faithful. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-5: In fact, they reject the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a confused state.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 56-86, 87: Now, if you are not subject to Our Will ˹as you claim˺, bring that soul back, if what you say is true. </li>
          <li>Quran 58-18: On the Day Allah resurrects them all, they will ˹falsely˺ swear to Him as they swear to you, thinking they have something to stand on. Indeed, it is they who are the ˹total˺ liars. </li>
          <li>Quran 68-39: Or do you have oaths binding on Us until the Day of Judgment that you will have whatever you decide? </li>
          <li>Quran 82-6, ..., 9: O humanity! What has emboldened you against your Lord, the Most Generous, Who created you, fashioned you, and perfected your design, moulding you in whatever form He willed? But no! In fact, you deny the ˹final˺ Judgment, </li>
          <li>Quran 96-6: Most certainly, one exceeds all bounds  once they think they are self-sufficient.  
          <li>Quran 104-1, ..., 9: Woe to every backbiter, slanderer,  who amasses wealth ˹greedily˺ and counts it ˹repeatedly˺, thinking that their wealth will make them immortal!  Not at all! Such a person will certainly be tossed into the Crusher.  And what will make you realize what the Crusher is? ˹It is˺ Allah’s kindled Fire, which rages over the hearts. It will be sealed over them, ˹tightly secured˺ with long braces.1 </li>

          <li>Exodus 10-19, ..., 23: And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</li>
          <li>Exodus 14-8, 9: And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.</li>
          <li>Exodus 15-22, ..., 27: So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?  And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee. And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</li>

          <li>Quran 4-37: those who are stingy, promote stinginess among people, and withhold Allah’s bounties. We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-75: And what is it with you? You do not fight in the cause of Allah and for oppressed men, women, and children who cry out, "Our Lord! Deliver us from this land of oppressors! Appoint for us a saviour; appoint for us a helper-all by Your grace."</li>
          <li>Quran 6-29:  They insisted, “There is nothing beyond this worldly life and we will never be resurrected.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-3: Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not take others as guardians besides Him. How seldom are you mindful! </li>
          <li>Quran 7-176: If We had willed, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to this life—following his evil desires. His example is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it ˹still˺ pants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs.1 So narrate ˹to them˺ stories ˹of the past˺, so perhaps they will reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-126: Do they not see that they are tried once or twice every year?1 Yet they neither repent nor do they learn a lesson. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-23: But as soon as He rescues them, they transgress in the land unjustly. O  humanity! Your transgression is only against your own souls. ˹There is only˺ brief enjoyment in this worldly life, then to Us is your return, and then We will inform you of what you used to do. 
          <li>Quran 11-106: As for those bound for misery, they will be in the Fire, where they will be sighing and gasping, </li>
          <li>Quran 12-105: How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by with indifference! </li>
          <li>Quran 15-13: They would not believe in this ˹Quran˺ despite the ˹many˺ examples of those ˹destroyed˺ before. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-103: And We surely know that they say, “No one is teaching him except a human.” But the man they refer to speaks a foreign tongue, whereas this ˹Quran˺ is ˹in˺ eloquent Arabic.1</li>
          <li>Quran 23-74, 75: but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are certainly deviating from that Path. ˹Even˺ if We had mercy on them and removed their affliction,1 they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91: They said, “Once we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be resurrected? We have already been promised this, as well as our forefathers earlier. This is nothing but ancient fables!” Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “To whom belong the earth and all those on it, if you ˹really˺ know?” They will reply, “To Allah!” Say, “Why are you not then mindful?” ˹And˺ ask ˹them˺, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne?” They will reply, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?” Ask ˹them also,˺ “In Whose Hands is the authority over all things, protecting ˹all˺ while none can protect against Him, if you ˹really˺ know?”  They will reply, “Allah.” Say, “How are you then so deluded?” In fact, We have brought them the truth, and they are certainly liars. Allah has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they would have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is Allah above what they claim!</li>
          <li>Quran 23-117: Whoever invokes, besides Allah, another god—for which they can have no proof—they will surely find their penalty with their Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will never succeed. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-53: They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if you ˹O Prophet˺ were to command them, they would certainly march forth ˹in Allah’s cause˺. Say, “˹You˺ do not ˹have to˺ swear; your obedience is well known!”1 Surely Allah is All-Aware of what you do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 25-40: They have certainly passed by the city ˹of Sodom˺, which had been showered with a dreadful rain ˹of stones˺. Have they not seen its ruins? But they do not expect to be resurrected. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-7:  Have they failed to look at the earth, ˹to see˺ how many types of fine plants We have caused to grow in it? </li>
          <li>Quran 26-67: Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-66:  No! Their knowledge of the Hereafter amounts to ignorance. In fact, they are in doubt about it. In truth, they are ˹totally˺ blind to it. </li>
          <li>Quran 30-29:  In fact, the wrongdoers merely follow their desires with no knowledge. Who then can guide those Allah has left to stray? They will have no helpers. </li>
          <li>Quran 32-10: ˹Still˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “When we are disintegrated into the earth, will we really be raised as a new creation?” In fact, they are in denial of the meeting with their Lord. </li>
          <li>Quran 32-27:  Do they not see how We drive rain to parched land, producing ˹various˺ crops from which they and their cattle eat? Will they not then see? </li>
          <li>Quran 37-137, 138: You ˹Meccans˺ certainly pass by their ruins day and night. Will you not then understand? </li>
          <li>Quran 39-47: Even if the wrongdoers were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves from the horrible punishment on Judgment Day, for they will see from Allah what they had never expected. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-41, 42: O  my people! How is it that I invite you to salvation, while you invite me to the Fire!  You invite me to disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him what I have no knowledge of, while I invite you to the Almighty, Most Forgiving. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-20: Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase their harvest. And whoever desires ˹only˺ the harvest of this world, We will give them some of it, but they will have no share in the Hereafter. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-38: But when such a person comes to Us, one will say ˹to their associate˺, “I wish you were as distant from me as the east is from the west! What an evil associate ˹you were˺!” </li>
          <li>Quran 43-66: Are they waiting for the Hour to take them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 44-34, ..., 36: Indeed, these ˹Meccans˺ say,  “There is nothing beyond our first death, and we will never be resurrected.  Bring ˹back˺ our forefathers, if what you say is true.” </li>
          <li>Quran 45-21: Or do those who commit evil deeds ˹simply˺ think that We will make them equal—in their life and after their death—to those who believe and do good? How wrong is their judgment! </li>
          <li>Quran 45-25: And whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only argument is to say: “Bring our forefathers back, if what you say is true!” </li>
          <li>Quran 45-32: And whenever it was said ˹to you˺, ‘Surely Allah’s promise ˹of judgment˺ is true and there is no doubt about the Hour,’ you said ˹mockingly˺, ‘We do not know what the Hour is! We think it is no more than speculation, and we are not convinced ˹that it will ever come˺.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 46-4: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Have you considered whatever ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created on earth! Or do they have a share in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens? Bring me a scripture ˹revealed˺ before this ˹Quran˺ or a shred of knowledge, if what you say is true.” </li>
          <li>Quran 47-29: Or do those with sickness in their hearts think that Allah will not ˹be able to˺ expose their malice? </li>
          <li>Quran 51-7, 8: ˹And˺ by the heavens in their marvellous design!1 Surely you are ˹lost˺ in conflicting views ˹regarding the truth˺.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 64-7: The disbelievers claim they will not be resurrected. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected, then you will certainly be informed of what you have done. And that is easy for Allah.” </li>
          <li>Quran 68-46, 47: Or are you asking them for a reward ˹for the message˺ so that they are overburdened by debt? Or do they have access to ˹the Record in˺ the unseen, so they copy it ˹for all to see˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 70-6, 7: They truly see this ˹Day˺ as impossible, but We see it as inevitable. </li>
          <li>Quran 70-38: Does every one of them expect to be admitted into a Garden of Bliss? </li>
          <li>Quran 80-17, ..., 32: Condemned are ˹disbelieving˺ humans! How ungrateful they are ˹to Allah˺! From what substance did He create them? He created them from a sperm-drop, and ordained their development. Then He makes the way easy for them,1 then causes them to die and be buried.1 Then when He wills, He will resurrect them. But no! They have failed to comply with what He ordered. Let people then consider their food: how We pour down rain in abundance  and meticulously split the earth open ˹for sprouts˺, causing grain to grow in it, as well as grapes and greens, and olives and palm trees, and dense orchards, and fruit and fodder—  all as ˹a means of˺ sustenance for you and your animals. </li>      </li>
          <li>Quran 82-17, 18, 19: What will make you realize what Judgment Day is? Again, what will make you realize what Judgment Day is? ˹It is˺ the Day no soul will be of ˹any˺ benefit to another whatsoever, for all authority on that Day belongs to Allah ˹entirely˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 83-4, 5, 6: Do such people not think that they will be resurrected for a tremendous Day— the Day ˹all˺ people will stand before the Lord of all worlds? </li>
          <li>Quran 84-13, ..., 15: For they used to be prideful among their people,  thinking they would never return ˹to Allah˺.  Yes ˹they would˺! Surely their Lord has always been All-Seeing of them. </li> 
          <li>Quran 90-5, 6, 7: Do they think that no one has power over them,  boasting, “I have wasted enormous wealth!”?  Do they think that no one sees them? </li>

            blamed by a wise man, and truly praised only when praised by a wise man."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 244: Life is easy for one who is shameless and bold as a crow, who slanders others and is
            pretentious, aggressive and corrupt.
            Verse 245: Life is hard for one with a sense of shame, who always seeks purity, who is free from attachment,
            who is modest and who sees clearly what is proper livelihood.</li>
          <li>The Story of Tissa: When the Buddha was told about this, he said, "Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is displeased
            with others receiving gifts and offerings can never attain Magga and Phala."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 253: In one who constantly sees the faults of others and is always disparaging them,
            moral intoxicants (asavas) increase; he is far from extinction of moral intoxicants (i.e., he is far from
            attainment of arahatship).</li>
          <li>The Story of Kapila the Fish: To the king and the audience, the Buddha explained, "O king! During the time
            of Kassapa Buddha there was a very learned bhikkhu who taught the Dhamma to others. Because of that good
            deed, when he was reborn in another existence, even as a fish, he was endowed with a golden body. But that
            bhikkhu was very greedy, proud and very contemptuous of others; he also disregarded the Disciplines and
            abused other bhikkhus. For these evil deeds, he was reborn in niraya, and now, he has become a beautiful
            fish with a mouth that stinks."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: His mother invited them into the house. But while she was offering food to
            her son she said, "O you consumer of left-overs, you who have abandoned eighty crores to become a bhikkhu,
            you have ruined us." Then, she offered alms-food to the other bhikkhus and said to them rudely, "You all
            have used my son as your attendant; now eat your food."</li>

          <li>Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, "In
            youth
            not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing worthy of being handed down; and living on to old
            age:-this is to be a pest." With this he hit him on the shank with his staff. (C.A. quote 629)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "The mean man is sure to gloss his faults." (C.A. quote 811)</li>

          </li>
          <li>Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, "Has the superior man likewise to endure in this way?" The
            Master said, "The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the mean man, when he is in want, gives
            way to unbridled license." (C.A. quote 634)</li>
          <li>The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic (C.A. quote 51)

          <li>Genesis 37-5, ..., 8: And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-105: The disbelievers from the People of the Book and the polytheists would not want you to receive any blessing from your Lord, but Allah selects whoever He wills for His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty. </li>
          <li>Qurn 2-231: When you divorce women and they have ˹almost˺ reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honourably or let them go honourably. But do not retain them ˹only˺ to harm them ˹or˺ to take advantage ˹of them˺. Whoever does that surely wrongs his own soul. Do not take Allah’s revelations lightly. Remember Allah’s favours upon you as well as the Book and wisdom1 He has sent down for your guidance. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-276: Allah has made interest fruitless and charity fruitful. And Allah does not like any ungrateful evildoer. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-118: O believers! Do not associate closely with others who would not miss a chance to harm you. Their only desire is to see you suffer. Their prejudice has become evident from what they say—and what their hearts hide is far worse. We have made Our revelations clear to you, if only you understood. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-130: O believers! Do not consume interest, multiplying it many times over. And be mindful of Allah, so you may prosper. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-108: They try to hide ˹their deception˺ from people, but they can never hide it from Allah—in Whose presence they plot by night what is displeasing to Him. And Allah is Fully Aware of what they do.</li>
          <li>Quran 4-114: There is no good in most of their secret talks—except those encouraging charity, kindness, or reconciliation between people. And whoever does this seeking Allah’s pleasure, We will grant them a great reward. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-16: He said, “For leaving me to stray I will lie in ambush for them on Your Straight Path. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-79: ˹There are˺ those who slander ˹some of˺ the believers for donating liberally and mock others for giving only the little they can afford. Allah will throw their mockery back at them, and they will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-81: Those ˹hypocrites˺ who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in defiance of the Messenger of Allah and hated ˹the prospect of˺ striving with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. They said ˹to one another˺, “Do not march forth in the heat.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The Fire of Hell is far hotter!” If only they could comprehend! </li>
          <li>Quran 9-95: When you return, they will swear to you by Allah so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone—they are truly evil. Hell will be their home as a reward for what they have committed. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-59: That was ’Âd. They denied the signs of their Lord, disobeyed His messengers, and followed the command of every stubborn tyrant. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-32: Other messengers had already been ridiculed before you, but I delayed the disbelievers ˹for a while˺ then seized them. And how ˹horrible˺ was My punishment! </li>
          <li>Quran 14-3: ˹They are˺ the ones who favour the life of this world over the Hereafter and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. It is they who have gone far astray. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-23: Without a doubt, Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal. He certainly does not like those who are too proud. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-88: For those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, We will add more punishment to their punishment for all the corruption they spread. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-48: See how they call you names ˹O Prophet˺!1 So they have gone so ˹far˺ astray that they cannot find the ˹Right˺ Way. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-46: He threatened, “How dare you reject my idols, O  Abraham! If you do not desist, I will certainly stone you ˹to death˺. So be gone from me for a long time!” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-41:  ˹Other˺ messengers had already been ridiculed before you ˹O Prophet˺, but those who mocked them were overtaken by what they used to ridicule. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-63: But the hearts of those ˹who disbelieve˺ are oblivious to ˹all of˺ this,1 and they have other ˹evil˺ deeds, opposite to this, in which they are engrossed.</li>
          <li>Quran 25-32: The disbelievers say, “If only the Quran had been sent down to him all at once!” ˹We have sent it˺ as such ˹in stages˺ so We may reassure your heart with it. And We have revealed it at a deliberate pace. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-41, 42: When they see you ˹O Prophet˺, they only make fun of you, ˹saying,˺ “Is this the one that Allah has sent as a messenger? He would have almost tricked us away from our gods, had we not been so devoted to them.” ˹But˺ soon they will know, when they face the punishment, who is far astray from the ˹Right˺ Way. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-111: They argued, “How can we believe in you, when you are followed ˹only˺ by the lowest of the low?”1</li>
          <li>Quran 26-185, ..., 189: They replied, “You are simply bewitched!  Also, you are only a human being like us, and we think you are indeed a liar.  So cause ˹deadly˺ pieces of the sky to fall upon us, if what you say is true.”  Shu’aib responded, “My Lord knows best whatever you do.”  So they rejected him, and ˹so˺ were overtaken by the torment of the day of the ˹deadly˺ cloud.1 That was really a torment of a tremendous day. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-56: But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel Lot’s followers from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!” </li>
          <li>Quran 28-76: Indeed, Korah1 was from the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had granted him such treasures that even their keys would burden a group of strong men. ˹Some of˺ his people advised him, “Do not be prideful! Surely Allah does not like the prideful. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-24: But the only response of Abraham’s people was to say: “Kill him or burn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire.1 Surely in this are signs for people who believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-47: Similarly ˹to earlier messengers˺, We have revealed to you a Book ˹O Prophet˺. ˹The faithful of˺ those to whom We gave the Scriptures believe in it, as do some of these ˹pagan Arabs˺. And none denies Our revelations except the ˹stubborn˺ disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-7: Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they turn away in arrogance as if they did not hear them, as if there is deafness in their ears. So give them good news ˹O Prophet˺ of a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 34-8: Has he fabricated a lie against Allah or is he insane?” In fact, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are bound for torment and have strayed farthest ˹from the truth˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 36-18, 19: The people replied, “We definitely see you as a bad omen for us. If you do not desist, we will certainly stone you ˹to death˺ and you will be touched with a painful punishment from us.” The messengers said, “Your bad omen lies within yourselves. Are you saying this because you are reminded ˹of the truth˺? In fact, you are a transgressing people.” </li>
          <li>Quran 38-2: ˹This is the truth,˺ yet the disbelievers are ˹entrenched˺ in arrogance and opposition. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-42:  Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land unjustly. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-8: They hear Allah’s revelations recited to them, then persist ˹in denial˺ arrogantly as if they did not hear them. So give them good news of a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 46-11: The disbelievers say of the believers, “Had it been ˹something˺ good, they1 would not have beaten us to it.” Now since they reject its guidance, they will say, “˹This is˺ an ancient fabrication!” </li>
          <li>Quran 47-8, 9: As for the disbelievers, may they be doomed and may He render their deeds void. That is because they detest what Allah has revealed, so He has rendered their deeds void. </li>
          <li>Quran 50-3: ˹Will we be returned to life,˺ when we are dead and reduced to dust? Such a return is impossible.” </li>
          <li>Quran 53-22: Then this is ˹truly˺ a biased distribution! 
          <li>Quran 57-24: those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people. And whoever turns away ˹should know that˺ Allah ˹alone˺ is truly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. </li>
          <li>Quran 58-2: Those of you who ˹sinfully˺ divorce their wives by comparing them to their mothers ˹should know that˺ their wives are in no way their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave birth to them. What they say is certainly detestable and false. Yet Allah is truly Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving. </li>
          <li>Quran 63-5: When it is said to them, “Come! The Messenger of Allah will pray for you to be forgiven,” they turn their heads ˹in disgust˺, and you see them ˹O Prophet˺ turn away in arrogance. </li>
          <li>Quran 68-51: The disbelievers would almost cut you down with their eyes when they hear ˹you recite˺ the Reminder,1 and say, “He is certainly a madman.” </li>
          <li>Quran 70-36, 37: So what is the matter with the disbelievers that they rush ˹head-long˺ towards you ˹O Prophet˺, from the right and the left, in groups ˹to mock you˺?1</li>
          <li>Quran 71-7: And whenever I invite them to be forgiven by You, they press their fingers into their ears, cover themselves with their clothes, persist ˹in denial˺, and act very arrogantly. </li>
          <li>Quran 84-20, 21, 22: So what is the matter with them that they do not believe,  and when the Quran is recited to them, they do not bow down ˹in submission˺?1  In fact, the disbelievers persist in denial. </li> 
          <li>Quran 100-1, ..., 11: ’ By the galloping, panting horses,  striking sparks of fire ˹with their hoofs˺, launching raids at dawn, stirring up ˹clouds of˺ dust,  and penetrating into the heart of enemy lines!  Surely humankind is ungrateful to their Lord— and they certainly attest to this—  and they are truly extreme in their love of ˹worldly˺ gains.  Do they not know that when the contents of the graves will be spilled out,  and the secrets of the hearts will be laid bare—  surely their Lord is All-Aware of them on that Day. </li>

            position, he kept on muttering, "O people! Bring me a hundred heads of cattle, many pieces of silver and a
            number of slaves. If you do not bring these to me, and if I were to fall down from this tree and die, this
            city of yours will surely come to ruin." The people of the town, fearing that their city night be destroyed

          <li>Genesis 37-18, ..., 20: And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.

          <li>Genesis 37-23, ..., 28: And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</li>
          <li>Genesis 39-11, ..., 20: And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.</li>
          <li>Genesis 8-26, ..., 32: And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-79: So woe1 to those who distort the Scripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a fleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-84, 85, 86: And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from the children of Israel ˹stating˺, “Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax.” But you ˹Israelites˺ turned away—except for a few of you—and were indifferent.  But here you are, killing each other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one another in sin and aggression; and when those ˹expelled˺ come to you as captives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for you.1 Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do.  These are the ones who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. So their punishment will not be reduced, nor will they be helped. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-93: And when We took your covenant and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear and disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How evil is what your ˹so-called˺ belief prompts you to do, if you ˹actually˺ believe ˹in the Torah˺!” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-159: Those who hide the clear proofs and guidance that We have revealed-after We made it clear for humanity in the Book-will be condemned by Allah and all those who condemn.</li>

          <li>Quran 3-112: They will be stricken with disgrace wherever they go, unless they are protected by a covenant with Allah or a treaty with the people. They have invited the displeasure of Allah and have been branded with misery for rejecting Allah’s revelations and murdering ˹His˺ prophets unjustly. This is ˹a fair reward˺ for their disobedience and violations. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-187: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when Allah took the covenant of those who were given the Scripture to make it known to people and not hide it, yet they cast it behind their backs and traded it for a fleeting gain. What a miserable profit! </li>
          <li>Quran 4-27:  And it is Allah’s Will to turn to you in grace, but those who follow their desires wish to see you deviate entirely ˹from Allah’s Way˺</li>

          <li>Quran 4-51: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who were given a portion of the Scriptures yet believe in idols and false gods and reassure the disbelievers1 that they are better guided than the believers? </li>
          <li>Quran 4-89: They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,1</li>
          <li>Quran 4-93: And whoever kills a believer intentionally, their reward will be Hell—where they will stay indefinitely.1 Allah will be displeased with them, condemn them, and will prepare for them a tremendous punishment. </li>

And whatever good you do is certainly well known to Allah.” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-150, 151: Surely those who deny Allah and His messengers and wish to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers,1 saying, “We believe in some and disbelieve in others,” desiring to forge a compromise, they are indeed the true disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-124: Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to place His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-125: Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.1 But whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-136: The pagans set aside for Allah a share of the crops and cattle He created, saying, “This ˹portion˺ is for Allah,” so they claim, “and this ˹one˺ for our associate-gods.” Yet the portion of their associate-gods is not shared with Allah while Allah’s portion is shared with their associate-gods. What unfair judgment! </li>
          <li>Quran 8-19: If you ˹Meccans˺ sought judgment, now it has come to you. And if you cease, it will be for your own good. But if you persist, We will persist. And your forces—no matter how numerous they might be—will not benefit you whatsoever. For Allah is certainly with the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-36: Surely the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder others from the Path of Allah. They will continue to spend to the point of regret. Then they will be defeated and the disbelievers will be driven into Hell, </li>
          <li>Quran 9-32: They wish to extinguish Allah’s light1 with their mouths, but Allah will only allow His light to be perfected, even to the dismay of the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-50: If a blessing befalls you ˹O Prophet˺, they grieve, but if a disaster befalls you, they say, “We took our precaution in advance,” and turn away, rejoicing. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-64: The hypocrites fear that a sûrah should be revealed about them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Keep mocking! Allah will definitely bring to light what you fear.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-67: The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage what is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold ˹what is in˺ their hands. They neglected Allah, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the rebellious. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-125: But as for those with sickness in their hearts,1 it has increased them only in wickedness upon their wickedness, and they die as disbelievers. 
          <li>Quran 10-66: Certainly to Allah ˹alone˺ belong all those in the heavens and all those on the earth. And what do those who associate others with Allah really follow? They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-60: They were followed by a curse in this world, as they will be on the Day of Judgment. Surely ’Âd denied their Lord. So away with ’Âd, the people of Hûd. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-79:  They argued, “You certainly know that we have no need for your daughters. You already know what we desire!” 
          <li>Quran 13-25: And those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺ Allah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land—it is they who will be condemned and will have the worst abode.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 16-58, 59: Whenever one of them is given the good news of a baby girl, his face grows gloomy, as he suppresses his rage. He hides himself from the people because of the bad news he has received. Should he keep her in disgrace, or bury her ˹alive˺ in the ground? Evil indeed is their judgment!1</li>
          <li>Quran 17-68, 69: Do you feel secure that He will not cause the land to swallow you up, or unleash upon you a storm of stones? Then you will find none to protect you. Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back to sea once again, and send upon you a violent storm, drowning you for your denial? Then you will find none to avenge you against Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-90, 91, 92, 93: They challenge ˹the Prophet˺, “We will never believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us, or until you have a garden of palm trees and vineyards, and cause rivers to flow abundantly in it, or cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or bring Allah and the angels before us, face to face, or until you have a house of gold, or you ascend into heaven—and even then we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book that we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I not only a human messenger?” </li>
          <li>Quran 18-56: We do not send the messengers except as deliverers of good news and warners. But the disbelievers argue in falsehood, ˹hoping˺ to discredit the truth with it, and make a mockery of My revelations and warnings. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-51: But those who strive to discredit Our revelations, they will be the residents of the Hellfire.” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-72: Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, you ˹O Prophet˺ recognize rage on the faces of the disbelievers, as if they are going to snap at those who recite Our revelations to them. Say, “Shall I inform you of something far more enraging than that? ˹It is˺ the Fire with which Allah has threatened those who disbelieve. What an evil destination!” </li>
          <li>Quran 23-66, 67: Indeed, My revelations were recited to you, but you used to back away ˹in disgust˺, boasting of the Sacred House, and babbling ˹nonsense about the Quran˺ by night.” </li>
          <li>Quran 24-19: Indeed, those who love to see indecency spread among the believers will suffer a painful punishment in this life and the Hereafter. Allah knows and you do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-154, 155, 156, 157, 158: You are only a human being like us, so bring forth a sign if what you say is true.”  Ṣâliḥ said, “Here is a camel. She will have her turn to drink as you have yours, each on an appointed day.  And do not ever touch her with harm, or you will be overtaken by the torment of a tremendous day.”  But they killed her, becoming regretful.  So the punishment overtook them. Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-13, 14: But when Our enlightening signs came to them, they said, “This is pure magic.” And, although their hearts were convinced the signs were true, they still denied them wrongfully and arrogantly. See then what was the end of the corruptors! </li>
          <li>Quran 29-29: Do you really lust after ˹other˺ men, abuse the travellers, and practice immorality ˹openly˺ in your gatherings?” His people’s only response was to say ˹mockingly˺: “Bring Allah’s punishment upon us, if what you say is true.” </li>
          <li>Quran 33-58: As for those who abuse believing men and women1 unjustifiably, they will definitely bear the guilt of slander and blatant sin.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-61: ˹They deserve to be˺ condemned. ˹If they were to persist,˺ they would get themselves seized and killed relentlessly wherever they are found!1</li>
          <li>Quran 39-45: Yet when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are filled with disgust. But as soon as those ˹gods˺ other than Him are mentioned, they are filled with joy. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-56: Surely those who dispute Allah’s signs—with no proof given to them—have nothing in their hearts but greed for dominance, which they will never attain. So seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He alone is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-27, 28: So We will certainly make the disbelievers taste a severe punishment, and We will surely repay them according to the worst of their deeds. That is the reward of Allah’s enemies: the Fire, which will be their eternal home—a ˹fitting˺ reward for their denial of Our revelations. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-29: The disbelievers will ˹then˺ cry, “Our Lord! Show us those jinn and humans who led us astray: we will put them under our feet so that they will be among the lowest ˹in Hell˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 43-36, 37: And whoever turns a blind eye to the Reminder of the Most Compassionate, We place at the disposal of each a devilish one as their close associate, who will certainly hinder them from the ˹Right˺ Way while they think they are ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-7: Woe to every sinful liar. </li>
          <li>Quran 47-22, 23, 24: Now if you ˹hypocrites˺ turn away, perhaps you would then spread corruption throughout the land and sever your ˹ties of˺ kinship!1  These are the ones who Allah has condemned, deafening them and blinding their eyes. Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Or are there locks upon their hearts? </li>
          <li>Quran 47-26: That is because they said ˹privately˺ to those who ˹also˺ detest what Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in some matters.”1 But Allah ˹fully˺ knows what they are hiding. </li>
          <li>Quran 47-28: This is because they follow whatever displeases Allah and hate whatever pleases Him, so He has rendered their deeds void.</li>
          <li>Quran 54-37: And they even demanded his angel-guests from him,1 so We blinded their eyes. ˹And they were told,˺ “Taste then My punishment and warnings!” </li>
          <li>Quran 54-46, 47, 48: Better yet, the Hour is their appointed time—and the Hour will be most catastrophic and most bitter. Indeed, the wicked are ˹entrenched˺ in misguidance, and ˹are bound for˺ blazes. On the Day they will be dragged into the Fire on their faces, ˹they will be told,˺ “Taste the touch of Hell!”1</li>
          <li>Quran 60-2: If they gain the upper hand over you, they would be your ˹open˺ enemies, unleashing their hands and tongues to harm you, and wishing that you would abandon faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 61-5: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Why do you hurt me when you already know I am Allah’s messenger to you?” So when they ˹persistently˺ deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people. </li>
          <li>Quran 61-8: They wish to extinguish Allah’s light with their mouths, but Allah will ˹certainly˺ perfect His light, even to the dismay of the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 63-3: This is because they believed and then abandoned faith. Therefore, their hearts have been sealed, so they do not comprehend. </li>
          <li>Quran 67-21: Or who is it that will provide for you if He withholds His provision? In fact, they persist in arrogance and aversion ˹to the truth˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 68-9: They wish you would compromise so they would yield ˹to you˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 68-10, ..., 13: And do not obey the despicable, vain oath-taker, slanderer, gossip-monger, withholder of good, transgressor, evildoer, brute, and—on top of all that—an illegitimate child. </li>
          <li>Quran 68-17, ..., 32: Indeed, We have tested those ˹Meccans˺ as We tested the owners of the garden—when they swore they would surely harvest ˹all˺ its fruit in the early morning, leaving no thought for Allah’s Will.1 Then it was struck by a torment from your Lord while they slept, so it was reduced to ashes. Then by daybreak they called out to each other, ˹saying,˺ “Go early to your harvest, if you want to pick ˹all˺ the fruit.” So they went off, whispering to one another, “Do not let any poor person enter your garden today.”  And they proceeded early, totally fixated on their purpose. But when they saw it ˹devastated˺, they cried, “We must have lost ˹our˺ way! In fact, we have been deprived ˹of our livelihood˺.” The most sensible of them said, “Did I not urge you to say, ‘Allah willing.’?” They replied, “Glory be to our Lord! We have truly been wrongdoers.” Then they turned on each other, throwing blame. They said, “Woe to us! We have certainly been transgressors. We trust our Lord will give us a better garden than this, ˹for˺ we are indeed turning to our Lord with hope.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 70-11, ..., 18: ˹although˺ they will be made to see each other. The wicked will wish to ransom themselves from the punishment of that Day by their children, their spouses, their siblings, their clan that sheltered them, and everyone on earth altogether, just to save themselves. But no! There will certainly be a raging Flame ripping off scalps. It will summon whoever turned their backs ˹on Allah˺ and turned away ˹from the truth˺, and gathered and hoarded ˹wealth˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 72-15: And as for the deviant, they will be fuel for Hell.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 72-16, 17: Had the deniers followed the Right Way, We would have certainly granted them abundant rain to drink— as a test for them.1 And whoever turns away from the remembrance of their Lord will be admitted by Him into an overwhelming punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 78-40: Indeed, We have warned you of an imminent punishment—the Day every person will see ˹the consequences of˺ what their hands have done, and the disbelievers will cry, “I wish I were dust.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 83-12: None would deny it except every evildoing transgressor. </li>
          <li>Quran 87-11, 12, 13: But it will be shunned by the most wretched, who will burn in the greatest Fire, where they will not ˹be able to˺ live or die. </li>
          <li>Quran 90-19, 20: As for those who deny Our signs, they are the people of the left.1 The Fire will be sealed over them. </li>
          <li>Quran 92-14, ..., 16: And so I have warned you of a raging Fire,  in which none will burn except the most wretched— who deny and turn away. </li>   
          <li>Quran 108-3: Only the one who hates you is truly cut off ˹from any goodness˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 111-1, ..., 5: May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he ˹himself˺ perish! Neither his wealth nor ˹worldly˺ gains will benefit him. He will burn in a flaming Fire, and ˹so will˺ his wife, the carrier of ˹thorny˺ kindling,1  around her neck will be a rope of palm-fibre.1</li>

          <li>The Story of Thera Upananda Sakyaputta: To the[m] the Buddha said, "One who teaches others should first
            teach himself and act as he has taught."</li>
          <li>The Story of Culasari: One day, Culasari came back after ministering to a patient. On his way he met Thera
            Sariputta and related to him how he went to treat a patient and had been given some delicious food for his
            services. He also begged Thera Sariputta to accept some of the food from him. Thera Sariputta did not say
            anything to him but continued on his way. Thera Sariputta refused to accept food from that bhikkhu because
            that bhikkhu had transgressed the law prohibiting bhikkhus from practising medicine. Other bhikkhus reported
            about this to the Buddha and he said to them, "Bhikkhus! A bhikkhu who is shameless is coarse in thought,
            word and deed. He is arrogant like a crow, he would find a living by unlawful means and live in comfort. On
            the other hand, life for a bhikkhu who has a sense of shame is not easy."</li>
          <li>The Story of Some Bhikkhus: When they went to the Buddha with this proposal, the Buddha, knowing full well
            their motive, turned it down. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus I do not say that you are good-hearted just
            because you can talk eloquently. Only he who has got rid of covetousness and all that is evil by means of
            Arahatta Magga is to be called a good-hearted man."</li>
          <li>The Story of an Old Brahmin: At the monastery, the brahmin told the Buddha how his sons had treated him
            and asked for his help. Then the Buddha gave him some verses to memorize and instructed him to recite them
            wherever there was a large gathering of people. The gist of the verses is this: "My four foolish sons are
            like ogres. They call me 'father, father', but the words come only out of their mouths and not from their
            hearts. They are deceitful and scheming. Taking the advice of their wives they have driven me out of their
            houses. So, now I have got to be begging. Those sons of mine are of less service to me than this staff of
            mine." When the old brahmin recited these verses, many people in the crowd, hearing him, went wild with rage
            at his sons and some even threatened to kill them.</li>

            to

          <li>Exodus 16-15, ..., 21: And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</li>

          <li>Quran 2-108: Or do you ˹believers˺ intend to ask of your Messenger as Moses was asked before?1 But whoever trades belief for disbelief has truly strayed from the Right Way. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-118: Those who have no knowledge say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign would come to us!” The same was said by those who came before. Their hearts are all alike. Indeed, We have made the signs clear for people of sure faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-204: There are some ˹hypocrites˺ who impress you with their views regarding worldly affairs and openly call upon Allah to witness what is in their hearts, yet they are your worst adversaries. </li>

          <li>Quran 2-267: O believers! Donate from the best of what you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth. Do not pick out worthless things for donation, which you yourselves would only accept with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-23: Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scriptures?1 Yet when they are invited to the Book of Allah to settle their disputes, some of them turn away heedlessly. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-61, 62: When it is said to them, “Come to Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” you see the hypocrites turn away from you stubbornly. How ˹horrible˺ will it be if a disaster strikes them because of what their hands have done, then they come to you swearing by Allah, “We intended nothing but goodwill and reconciliation.”  </li>
          <li>Quran 4-112: And whoever commits an evil or sinful deed then blames it on an innocent person, they will definitely bear the guilt of slander and blatant sin. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159: The People of the Book demand that you ˹O Prophet˺ bring down for them a revelation in writing from heaven.1 They demanded what is even greater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after their repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof. We raised the Mount over them ˹as a warning˺ for ˹breaking˺ their covenant and said, “Enter the gate ˹of Jerusalem˺ with humility.” We also warned them, “Do not break the Sabbath,” and took from them a firm covenant. ˹They were condemned˺ for breaking their covenant, rejecting Allah’s signs, killing the prophets unjustly, and for saying, “Our hearts are unreceptive!”1—it is Allah Who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few— and for their denial and outrageous accusation against Mary,1 and for boasting, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they neither killed nor crucified him—it was only made to appear so.1 Even those who argue for this ˹crucifixion˺ are in doubt. They have no knowledge whatsoever—only making assumptions. They certainly did not kill him Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. Every one of the People of the Book will definitely believe in him before his death.1 And on the Day of Judgment Jesus will be a witness against them. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-36: As for the disbelievers, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over ˹and offer it all˺ to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted from them. And they will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-43: But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-61: When they come to you ˹believers˺ they say, “We believe.” But they are committed to disbelief when they enter and when they leave. And Allah knows what they hide. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-31: Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah until the Hour takes them by surprise, then they will cry, “Woe to us for having ignored this!” They will bear ˹the burden of˺ their sins on their backs. Evil indeed is their burden! </li>
          <li>Quran 6-157: Nor can you say, “If only the Scriptures had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.” Now there has come to you from your Lord a clear proof1—a guide and mercy. Who then does more wrong than those who deny Allah’s revelations and turn away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our revelations with a dreadful punishment for turning away. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-45: those who hindered ˹others˺ from Allah’s Way, strived to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, and disbelieved in the Hereafter.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-134, 135: When tormented, they pleaded, “O Moses! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If you help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you.” But as soon as We removed the torment from them—until they met their inevitable fate1—they broke their promise. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-8: How ˹can they have a treaty˺? If they were to have the upper hand over you, they would have no respect for kinship or treaty. They only flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are in denial, and most of them are rebellious. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-56: They swear by Allah that they are part of you, but they are not. They only say so out of fear. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-61, 62: And there are others who hurt the Prophet by saying, “He listens to anyone.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He listens to what is best for you. He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy for those who believe among you.” Those who hurt Allah’s Messenger will suffer a painful punishment. They swear by Allah to you ˹believers˺ in order to please you, while it is the pleasure of Allah and His Messenger they should seek, if they are ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-67, 68:  The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage what is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold ˹what is in˺ their hands. They neglected Allah, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the rebellious. Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers an everlasting stay in the Fire of Hell—it is sufficient for them. Allah has condemned them, and they will suffer a never-ending punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-75, 76: And there are some who had made a vow to Allah: “If He gives us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be of the righteous.” But when He gave them out of His bounty, they withheld it and turned away indifferently. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-98: And among the nomads are those who consider what they donate to be a loss and await your misfortune. May ill-fortune befall them! And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</li>
          <li>Quran 10-2: Is it astonishing to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves, ˹instructing him,˺ “Warn humanity and give good news to the believers that they will have an honourable status with their Lord.”? Yet the disbelievers said, “Indeed, this ˹man˺ is clearly a magician!” 
          <li>Quran 10-76: When the truth came to them from Us, they said, “This is certainly pure magic!” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-110: Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose regarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,1 their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺. They are truly in alarming doubt about it. f</li>
          <li>Quran 12-11, 12: They said, “O our father! Why do you not trust us with Joseph, although we truly wish him well? Send him out with us tomorrow so that he may enjoy himself and play. And we will really watch over him.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-9: Have you not ˹already˺ received the stories of those who were before you: the people of Noah, ’Âd, Thamûd, and those after them? Only Allah knows how many they were. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands over their mouths1 and said, “We totally reject what you have been sent with, and we are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-21: They will all appear before Allah, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, so will you ˹then˺ protect us from Allah’s torment in any way?” They will reply, “Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. ˹Now˺ it is all the same for us whether we suffer patiently or impatiently, there is no escape for us.” 
          <li>Quran 15-14, 15: And even if We opened for them a gate to heaven, through which they continued to ascend, still they would say, “Our eyes have truly been dazzled! In fact, we must have been bewitched.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-24: And when it is said to them, “What has your Lord revealed?” They say, “Ancient fables!” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-94: And do not take your oaths as a means of deceiving one another or your feet will slip after they have been firm. Then you will taste the evil ˹consequences˺ of hindering ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and you will suffer a tremendous punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-73: They definitely ˹thought they˺ were about to lure you away from what We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, hoping that you would attribute something else to Us falsely—and then they would have certainly taken you as a close friend.1</li>
          <li>Quran 19-66: Yet ˹some˺ people ask ˹mockingly˺, “After I die, will I really be raised to life again?”</li>
          <li>Quran 20-63, 64: They concluded, “These two are only magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic, and do away with your most cherished traditions. So orchestrate your plan, then come forward in ˹perfect˺ ranks. And whoever prevails today will certainly be successful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-96: He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful ˹of dust˺ from the hoof-prints of ˹the horse of˺ the messenger-angel ˹Gabriel˺ then cast it ˹on the moulded calf˺. This is what my lower-self tempted me into.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 20-134: Had We destroyed them with a torment before this ˹Prophet came˺, they would have surely argued, “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and put to shame.” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-6: Not a ˹single˺ society We destroyed before them ever believed ˹after receiving the signs˺. Will these ˹pagans˺ then believe? </li>
          <li>Quran 21-29:  Whoever of them were to say, “I am a god besides Him,” they would be rewarded with Hell by Us. This is how We reward the wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-55: Yet the disbelievers will persist in doubt about this ˹revelation˺ until the Hour takes them by surprise, or the torment of a terminating1 Day comes to them. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-23, 24, 25: Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He declared, “O my people! Worship Allah ˹alone˺. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?” But the disbelieving chiefs of his people said ˹to the masses˺, “This is only a human like you, who wants to be superior to you. Had Allah willed, He could have easily sent down angels ˹instead˺. We have never heard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers. He is simply insane, so bear with him for a while.”1  </li>
          <li>Quran 25-7, 8, 9: And they say ˹mockingly˺, “What kind of messenger is this who eats food and goes about in market-places ˹for a living˺? If only an angel had been sent down with him to be his co-warner, or a treasure had been cast down to him, or he had had a garden from which he may eat!” And the wrongdoers say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only following a bewitched man.” See ˹O Prophet˺ how they call you names!1 So they have gone so ˹far˺ astray that they cannot find the ˹Right˺ Way. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-21: Those who do not expect to meet Us say, “If only the angels were sent down to us, or we could see our Lord!” They have certainly been carried away by their arrogance and have entirely exceeded all limits. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-70, ..., 77: when he questioned his father and his people, “What is that you worship ˹besides Allah˺?” They replied, “We worship idols, to which we are fully devoted.” Abraham asked, “Can they hear you when you call upon them? Or can they benefit or harm you?” They replied, “No! But we found our forefathers doing the same.”  Abraham responded, “Have you ˹really˺ considered what you have been worshipping— you and your ancestors? They are ˹all˺ enemies to me, except the Lord of all worlds. </li>
          <li>Quran 26-136, 137, 138, 139: They responded, “It is all the same to us whether you warn ˹us˺ or not.  This is simply the tradition of our predecessors.  And we will never be punished.”  So they rejected him, and ˹so˺ We destroyed them. Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-84, 85: When they ˹finally˺ come before their Lord, He will ask ˹them˺, “Did you deny My revelations without ˹even˺ comprehending them? Or what ˹exactly˺ did you do?” And the decree ˹of torment˺ will be justified against them for their wrongdoing, leaving them speechless. </li>
          <li>Quran 29-10: There are some who say, “We believe in Allah,” but when they suffer in the cause of Allah, they mistake ˹this˺ persecution at the hands of people for the punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they surely say ˹to the believers˺, “We have always been with you.” Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of all beings?</li>
          <li>Quran 29-12: The disbelievers say to the believers, “˹Just˺ follow our way, and we will bear ˹the burden of˺ your sins.” But they would never ˹want to˺ bear any of the believers’ sins. They are simply lying. </li>
          <li>Quran 31-6: But there are some who employ theatrics,1 only to lead others away from Allah’s Way—without any knowledge—and to make a mockery of it. They will suffer a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 33-18: Allah knows well those among you who discourage ˹others from fighting˺, saying ˹secretly˺ to their brothers, “Stay with us,” and who themselves hardly take part in fighting.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-19: They are˺ totally unwilling to assist you. When danger comes, you see them staring at you with their eyes rolling like someone in the throes of death. But once the danger is over, they slash you with razor-sharp tongues, ravenous for ˹worldly˺ gains. Such people have not ˹truly˺ believed, so Allah has rendered their deeds void. And that is easy for Allah.</li>
          <li>Quran 33-20: They ˹still˺ think that the enemy alliance has not ˹yet˺ withdrawn. And if the allies were to come ˹again˺, the hypocrites would wish to be away in the desert among nomadic Arabs, ˹only˺ asking for news about you ˹believers˺. And if the hypocrites were in your midst, they would hardly take part in the fight.</li>
          <li>Quran 37-10: But whoever manages to stealthily eavesdrop is ˹instantly˺ pursued by a piercing flare. </li>
          <li>Quran 37-14, 15: And whenever they see a sign, they make fun of it, saying, “This is nothing but pure magic. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-4: None disputes the signs of Allah except the disbelievers, so do not be deceived by their prosperity throughout the land. </li>
          <li>Quran 40-85: But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our torment. This has ˹always˺ been Allah’s way ˹of dealing˺ with His ˹wicked˺ servants. Then and there the disbelievers were in ˹total˺ loss. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-51: When We show favour to someone, they turn away, acting arrogantly. And when touched with evil, they make endless prayers ˹for good˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-16: As for those who dispute about Allah after He is ˹already˺ acknowledged ˹by many˺, their argument is futile in the sight of their Lord. Upon them is wrath, and they will suffer a severe punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 42-20: And they argue, “Had the Most Compassionate willed, we would have never worshipped them.” They have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They do nothing but lie. </li>
          <li>Quran 44-15: Indeed, We will remove ˹that˺ torment for a while, and you ˹Meccans˺ will return ˹to disbelief˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-9: And whenever they learn anything of Our revelations, they make a mockery of it. It is they who will suffer a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 45-23: Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ those who have taken their own desires as their god? ˹And so˺ Allah left them to stray knowingly, sealed their hearing and hearts, and placed a cover on their sight. Who then can guide them after Allah? Will you ˹all˺ not then be mindful? </li>
          <li>Quran 46-5: And who could be more astray than those who call upon others besides Allah—˹others˺ that cannot respond to them until the Day of Judgment, and are ˹even˺ unaware of their calls? </li>
          <li>Quran 46-7: Whenever Our clear revelations are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them, “This is pure magic.” </li>
          <li>Quran 47-16: There are some of them who listen to you ˹O Prophet˺, but when they depart from you, they say ˹mockingly˺ to those ˹believers˺ gifted with knowledge, “What did he just say?” These are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed and who ˹only˺ follow their desires. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-15: Those who stayed behind will say, when you ˹believers˺ set out to take the spoils of war, “Let us accompany you.” They wish to change Allah’s promise.1 Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “You will not accompany us. This is what Allah has said before.” They will then say, “In fact, you are driven by jealousy against us!”2 The truth is: they can hardly comprehend. </li>
          <li>Quran 51-52: Similarly, no messenger came to those before them without being told: “A magician or a madman!” </li>
          <li>Quran 53-24: Or should every person ˹simply˺ have whatever ˹intercessors˺ they desire?1</li>
          <li>Quran 53-27, 28: Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter label angels as female, although they have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this. They follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions. And surely assumptions can in no way replace the truth. </li>
          <li>Quran 57-14: The tormented will cry out to those graced, “Were we not with you?” They will reply, “Yes ˹you were˺. But you chose to be tempted ˹by hypocrisy˺, ˹eagerly˺ awaited ˹our demise˺, doubted ˹the truth˺, and were deluded by false hopes until Allah’s decree ˹of your death˺ came to pass. And ˹so˺ the Chief Deceiver1 deceived you about Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 58-8: Have you not seen those who were forbidden from secret talks, yet they ˹always˺ return to what they were forbidden from, conspiring in sin, aggression, and disobedience to the Messenger? And when they come to you ˹O Prophet˺, they greet you not as Allah greets you,1 and say to one another, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough for them—they will burn in it. And what an evil destination! </li>
          <li>Quran 58-16: They have made their ˹false˺ oaths as a shield, hindering ˹others˺ from the cause of Allah. So they will suffer a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-11: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen the hypocrites who say to their fellow disbelievers from the People of the Book,1 “If you are expelled, we will certainly leave with you, and We will never obey anyone against you. And if you are fought against, we will surely help you.”? But Allah bears witness that they are truly liars. </li>
          <li>Quran 61-6: And ˹remember˺ when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O children of Israel! I am truly Allah’s messenger to you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and giving good news of a messenger after me whose name will be Aḥmad.”1 Yet when the Prophet came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is pure magic.” </li>
          <li>Quran 63-1: When the hypocrites come to you ˹O Prophet˺, they say, “We bear witness that you are certainly the Messenger of Allah”—and surely Allah knows that you are His Messenger—but Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are truly liars. </li>
          <li>Quran 69-41, 42, 43: It is not the prose of a poet ˹as you claim˺, ˹yet˺ you hardly have any faith. Nor is it the mumbling of a fortune-teller, ˹yet˺ you are hardly mindful. ˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds. </li>
          <li>Quran 75-5, ..., 15: Still people want to deny what is yet to come, asking ˹mockingly˺, “When is this Day of Judgment?” But when the sight is stunned, and the moon is dimmed, and the sun and the moon are brought together,1 on that Day one will cry, “Where is the escape?” But no! There will be no refuge. On that Day all will end up before your Lord. All will then be informed of what they have sent forth and left behind. In fact, people will testify against their own souls,1 despite the excuses they come up with. </li>
          <li>Quran 77-48: When it is said to them, “Bow down ˹before Allah,” they do not bow. </li>
          <li>Quran 83-13, 14: Whenever Our revelations are recited to them, they say, “Ancient fables!”  But no! In fact, their hearts have been stained by all ˹the evil˺ they used to commit! </li>
          <li>Quran 83-29, ..., 33: Indeed, the wicked used to laugh at the believers, wink to one another whenever they passed by, and muse ˹over these exploits˺ upon returning to their own people. And when they saw the faithful, they would say, “These ˹people˺ are truly astray,” even though they were not sent as keepers over the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 107-1, ..., 7: Have you seen the one who denies the ˹final˺ Judgment?  That is the one who repulses the orphan, and does not encourage the feeding of the poor. So woe to those ˹hypocrites˺ who pray yet are unmindful of their prayers; those who ˹only˺ show off,  and refuse to give ˹even the simplest˺ aid.1 </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 19: Though he recites much the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but is negligent and does not
            practise according to the Dhamma, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others, he has no share in the
            benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).</li>
          <li>The Story of Some Ladies Observing the Moral Precepts: When she told the Buddha about the various answers
            of the different age groups of ladies, the Buddha said, "Visakha! birth, ageing and death are always
            actively working in beings; because one is born, one is subject to ageing and decay, and finally to death.
            Yet, they do not wish to strive for liberation from the round of existences (samsara); they still wish to
            linger in samsara"</li>
          <li>The Story of Laludayi: When the Buddha was told about this incident, he said, "Laludayi had learned very
            little of the Dhamma; he does not recite the religious texts regularly; he has not memorized anything.
            Whatever little he has learned gets rusty by not reciting."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 252: It is easy to see the faults of others, but difficult to see one's own. A man
            broadcasts the fault; of others like winnowing chaff in the wind, but hides his own faults as a crafty
            fowler covers himself. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Bhaddiya: Whereupon, the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus! That person is not a samanera,
            he is a senior bhikkhu although he is small-built and very unassuming. I do say that one is not a thera just
            because he is old and looks like a thera; only he who comprehends the Four Noble Truths and does not harm
            others is to be called a thera."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Old Bhikkhus: The Buddha called those bhikkhus to him and said, "Bhikkhus! You all are
            feeling pain and sorrow because you are not free from greed, hatred, and ignorance (raga, dosa, moha), which
            are like a forest. Cut down this forest and you will be freed from greed, hatred and ignorance."</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera Sanu: As his mother was busy cooking his meal, the ogress, who was his mother of a
            past existence, thought, "If my son Sanu leaves the Order, I shall be put to shame and become a laughing
            stock among other ogres and devas; I must try and stop him leaving the Order." So, the young samanera was
            possessed by her; the boy rolled on the floor, muttering in coherently with saliva streaming out of his
            mouth. The mother got alarmed; neighbours came and tried to appease the spirits. Then, the ogress spoke out
            "This samanera wants to leave the religious Order and return to the life of a lay man; if he does so he will
            not be able to escape from dukkha." After saying those words, the ogress left the body of the boy and the
            boy became normal again.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Mahapajapati Gotami: To them the Buddha replied, "Why do you say so? I myself gave the
            eight garudhammas to Mahapajapati and she had learnt and practised the garudhammas as required by me. I
            myself am her preceptor and it is quite wrong for you to say that she has no preceptor. You should harbour

            "Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness." (C.A. quote 614) The Master said,

            so?" The Master said, "It is according to the rules of propriety,' they say. Are gems and silk all that is
            meant by propriety? 'It is music,' they say. Are hers and drums all that is meant by music?" (C.A. quote

            quote 751) The Master said, "Your good, careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue." (C.A.

          <li>Quran 2-76: When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But in private they say ˹to each other˺, “Will you disclose to the believers the knowledge Allah has revealed to you,1 so that they may use it against you before your Lord? Do you not understand?” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-266: Would any of you wish to have a garden with palm trees, grapevines, and all kinds of fruits with rivers flowing underneath and as they grow very old with dependent children, a fiery whirlwind hits the garden, burning it all up? This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-153: ˹Remember˺ when you were running far away ˹in panic˺—not looking at anyone—while the Messenger was calling to you from behind! So Allah rewarded your disobedience with distress upon distress. Now, do not grieve over the victory you were denied or the injury you suffered. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-54: Or do they envy the people for Allah’s bounties? Indeed, We have given the descendants of Abraham the Book and wisdom, along with great authority. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-91: You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-142: Surely the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He outwits them. When they stand up for prayer, they do it half-heartedly only to be seen by people—hardly remembering Allah at all. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-143: Torn between belief and disbelief—belonging neither to these ˹believers˺ nor those ˹disbelievers˺. And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-33: We certainly know that what they say grieves you ˹O Prophet˺. It is not your honesty they question—it is Allah’s signs that the wrongdoers deny. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-9: But those whose scale is light, they have doomed themselves for wrongfully denying Our signs. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-131: In times of prosperity, they said, “This is what we deserve,” but in adversity, they blamed it on Moses and those with him.1 Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of them did not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-138: We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols. They demanded, “O Moses! Make for us a god like their gods.” He replied, “Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly! </li>
          <li>Quran 8-35: Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for your disbelief. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-19: Do you ˹pagans˺ consider providing the pilgrims with water and maintaining the Sacred Mosque as equal to believing in Allah and the Last Day and struggling in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in Allah’s sight. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 
          <li>Quran 9-42: Had the gain been within reach and the journey shorter, they would have followed you, but the distance seemed too long for them. And they will swear by Allah, “Had we been able, we would have certainly joined you.” They are ruining themselves. And Allah knows that they are surely lying. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-49: There are some of them who say, “Exempt me and do not expose me to temptation.”1 They have already fallen into temptation. And Hell will surely engulf the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-54: And what prevented their donations from being accepted is that they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger, they never come to prayer except half-heartedly, and they never donate except resentfully. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-12: Whenever someone is touched by hardship, they cry out to Us, whether lying on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their hardship, they return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any hardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made appealing to them. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-9: If We give people a taste of Our mercy then take it away from them, they become utterly desperate, ungrateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-38: So he began to build the Ark, and whenever some of the chiefs of his people passed by, they mocked him. He said, “If you laugh at us, we will ˹soon˺ laugh at you similarly. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-106: And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others with Him ˹in worship˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-26: Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And the disbelievers become prideful of ˹the pleasures of˺ this worldly life. But the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-101: When We replace a verse with another1—and Allah knows best what He reveals—they say, “You ˹Muḥammad˺ are just a fabricator.” In fact, most of them do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-106: That is their reward: Hell, for their disbelief and mockery of My signs and messengers. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-27: Then she returned to her people, carrying him. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! O  sister of Aaron!1 Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.” So she pointed to the baby. They exclaimed, “How can we talk to someone who is an infant in the cradle?” ˹Jesus˺ declared, “I am truly a servant of Allah. He has destined me to be given the Scripture and to be a prophet. He has made me a blessing wherever I go, and bid me to establish prayer and give alms-tax as long as I live, and to be kind to my mother. He has not made me arrogant or defiant. Peace be upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I will be raised back to life!” That is Jesus, son of Mary. ˹And this is˺ a word of truth, about which they dispute. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-56, 57, 58, 59, 60:  And We certainly showed Pharaoh all of Our signs,1 but he denied them and refused ˹to believe˺. He said, “Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O  Moses? We can surely meet you with similar magic. So set for us an appointment that neither of us will fail to keep, in a central place.” Moses said, “Your appointment is on the Day of the Festival, and let the people be gathered mid-morning.” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-36: When the disbelievers see you ˹O Prophet˺, they only make fun of you, ˹saying,˺ “Is this the one who speaks ˹ill˺ of your gods?” while they disbelieve at the mention of the Most Compassionate. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-11: And there are some who worship Allah on the verge ˹of faith˺: if they are blessed with something good, they are content with it; but if they are afflicted with a trial, they relapse ˹into disbelief˺,1 losing this world and the Hereafter. That is ˹truly˺ the clearest loss. </li>
          <li>Quran 23-33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38: But the chiefs of his people—who disbelieved, denied the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter, and were spoiled by the worldly luxuries We had provided for them—said ˹to the masses˺, “This is only a human like you. He eats what you eat, and drinks what you drink. And if you ˹ever˺ obey a human like yourselves, then you would certainly be losers.  Does he promise you that once you are dead and reduced to dust and bones, you will be brought forth ˹alive˺?  Impossible, simply impossible is what you are promised!  There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die, others are born, and none will be resurrected.  He is no more than a man who has fabricated a lie about Allah, and we will never believe in him.” </li>
          <li>Quran 23-99, 100, 101: When death approaches any of them, they cry, “My Lord! Let me go back, so I may do good in what I left behind.” Never! It is only a ˹useless˺ appeal they make. And there is a barrier behind them until the Day they are resurrected.1 Then, when the Trumpet will be blown,1 there will be no kinship between them on that Day, nor will they ˹even care to˺ ask about one another.2  </li>
          <li>Quran 24-48, 49: And as soon as they are called to Allah and His Messenger so he may judge between them, a group of them1 turns away. But if the truth is in their favour, they come to him, fully submitting. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-60: When it is said to them, “Prostrate to the Most Compassionate,” they ask ˹in disgust˺, “What is ‘the Most Compassionate’? Will we prostrate to whatever you order us to?” And it only drives them farther away. </li>
          <li>Quran 28-48: But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what Moses had been given.”1 Did they not deny what had been given to Moses earlier? They claimed, “Both ˹Scriptures˺ are works of magic, supporting each other!”2 Adding, “We truly deny both.” </li>
          <li>Quran 28-79: Then he came out before his people in all his glamour. Those who desired the life of this world wished, “If only we could have something like what Korah has been given. He is truly a man of great fortune!” </li>
          <li>Quran 29-2: Do people think once they say, “We believe,” that they will be left without being put to the test? </li>
          <li>Quran 29-25: He said ˹to his people˺, “You have taken idols ˹for worship˺ instead of Allah, only to keep ˹the bond of˺ harmony among yourselves in this worldly life. But on the Day of Judgment you will disown and curse one another. Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helper!” </li>
          <li>Quran 41-49: One never tires of praying for good. And if touched with evil, they become desperate and hopeless. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-65: Yet their ˹various˺ groups have differed among themselves ˹about him˺, so woe to the wrongdoers when they face the torment of a painful Day! </li>
          <li>Quran 54-24, ..., 31: arguing, “How can we follow one ˹average˺ human being from among us? We would then truly be misguided and insane. Has the revelation been sent down ˹only˺ to him out of ˹all of˺ us? In fact, he is a boastful liar.” ˹It was revealed to Ṣâliḥ,˺ “They will soon know who the boastful liar is. We are sending the she-camel as a test for them. So watch them ˹closely˺, and have patience. And tell them that the ˹drinking˺ water must be divided between them ˹and her˺, each taking a turn to drink ˹every other day˺.” But they roused a companion of theirs, so he dared to kill ˹her˺. Then how ˹dreadful˺ were My punishment and warnings!  Indeed, We sent against them ˹only˺ one ˹mighty˺ blast, leaving them like the twigs of fence-builders. </li>
          <li>Quran 58-14: Have you not seen those ˹hypocrites˺ who ally themselves with a people with whom Allah is displeased? They are neither with you nor with them. And they swear to lies knowingly. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-12: Indeed, if they are expelled, the hypocrites will never leave with them. And if they are fought against, the hypocrites will never help them. And even if the hypocrites did so, they would certainly flee, then the disbelievers would be left with no help. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-13: Indeed, there is more fear in their hearts for you ˹believers˺ than for Allah. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend. </li>
          <li>Quran 59-14: Even united, they would not ˹dare˺ fight against you except ˹from˺ within fortified strongholds or from behind walls. Their malice for each other is intense: you think they are united, yet their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people with no ˹real˺ understanding. </li>
          <li>Quran 68-14, 15: Now, ˹simply˺ because he has been blessed with ˹abundant˺ wealth and children, whenever Our revelations are recited to him, he says, “Ancient fables!” </li>
          <li>Quran 77-35, 36: On that Day they will not ˹be in a position to˺ speak, nor will they be permitted to offer excuses. </li>
          <li>Quran 79-42, ..., 44: They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” But it is not for you to tell its time.1 That knowledge rests with your Lord ˹alone˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 101-8, ..., 11: And as for those whose scale is light, their home will be the abyss. And what will make you realize what that is? ˹It is˺ a scorching Fire. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 72: The skill of a fool can only harm him; it destroys his merit and his wisdom (lit.,

          <li>The Story of Bhikkhu Hatthaka: The Buddha called Hatthaka to him and said, "Bhikkhu! Why do you behave in
            this way? One who says such things cannot become a samana in spite of his shaven head. Only one who has rid
            himself of all evil is to be called a samana."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Baddiya Bhikkhus: When the Buddha was told about this he said, "Bhikkhus, you have

            making slippers and decorating them."</li>

          <li>The Story of a Bhikkhu Who Killed a Swan (Hamsa): The Buddha reprimanded him and said, "My son, why have

            all beings and who should be striving ardently for liberation from the round of rebirths? Even during the
            period outside the Teaching, the wise practised morality and observed the precepts. A bhikkhu must have

          <li>The Master said, "Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the
            conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But
            it
            is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their
            aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him (C.A. quote

          <li>Tsze-lu happening to pass the night in Shih-man, the gatekeeper said to him, "Whom do you come from?"

            of the times and yet will be doing in them." (C.A. quote 621)</li>
          <li>The Master then inquired, "Ts'ze, have you also your hatreds?" Tsze-kung replied, "I hate those who pry
            out matters, and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who are only not modest, and think
            that
            they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward." (C.A.
            quote 773) The Master said, "Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you

            peace-makers!”1. Indeed, it is they who are the corruptors, but they fail to perceive it. And when they are
            told, “Believe as others believe,” they reply, “Will we believe as the fools believe?” Indeed, it is they
            who are fools, but they do not know.

          <li>Quran 2-246: Have you not seen those chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses? They said to one of their prophets, “Appoint for us a king, ˹and˺ we will fight in the cause of Allah.” He said, “Are you not going to cower if ordered to fight?” They replied, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, while we were driven out of our homes and ˹separated from˺ our children?” But when they were ordered to fight, they fled, except for a few of them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-70: O People of the Book! Why do you reject the signs of Allah while you bear witness ˹to their truth˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 4-144: O believers! Do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Would you like to give Allah solid proof against yourselves? </li>
          <li>Quran 6-139: They ˹also˺ say, “The offspring of this cattle is reserved for our males and forbidden to our females; but if it is stillborn, they may all share it.” He will repay them for their falsehood. Surely He is All-Wise, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-140: Lost indeed are those who have murdered their own children foolishly out of ignorance and have forbidden what Allah has provided for them—falsely attributing lies to Allah. They have certainly strayed and are not ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-21: Do not be like those who say, “We hear,” but in fact they are not listening. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-34: O believers! Indeed, many rabbis and monks consume people’s wealth wrongfully and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah. Give good news of a painful torment to those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah’s cause. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-74: They swear by Allah that they never said anything ˹blasphemous˺, while they did in fact utter a blasphemy, lost faith after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not carry out.1 It is only through resentment that they pay Allah and His Messenger back for enriching them out of His bounty! If they repent, it will be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no one on earth to protect or help them. 
          <li>Quran 9-101: Some of the nomads around you ˹believers˺ are hypocrites, as are some of the people of Medina. They have mastered hypocrisy. They are not known to you ˹O Prophet˺; they are known to Us. We will punish them twice ˹in this world˺,1 then they will be brought back ˹to their Lord˺ for a tremendous punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-50: Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Imagine if His torment were to overcome you by night or day—do the wicked realize what they are ˹really˺ asking Him to hasten? </li>
          <li>Quran 16-62: They attribute to Allah what they hate ˹for themselves˺,1 and their tongues utter the lie that they will have the finest reward. Without a doubt, for them is the Fire, where they will be abandoned. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-13: They invoke those whose worship leads to harm, not benefit. What an evil patron and what an evil associate! </li>
          <li>Quran 23-64, 65: But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to cry for help. ˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry for help today. Surely you will never be saved from Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 24-47: And the hypocrites say, “We believe in Allah and the Messenger, and we obey.” Then a group of them turns away soon after that. These are not ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 25-55:  Yet they worship besides Allah what can neither benefit nor harm them. And the disbeliever always collaborates against their Lord. </li>
          <li>Quran 27-49: They vowed, “Let us swear by Allah that we will take him and his family down by night. Then we will certainly say to his ˹closest˺ heirs, ‘We did not witness the murder of his family. We are definitely telling the truth.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 35-42, 43: They swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a warner were to come to them, they would certainly be better guided than any other community. Yet when a warner did come to them, it only drove them farther away— behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil. But evil plotting only backfires on those who plot. Are they awaiting anything but the fate of those ˹destroyed˺ before? You will find no change in the way of Allah, nor will you find it diverted ˹to someone else˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 39-8: When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He showers them with blessings from Him, they ˹totally˺ forget the One they had cried to earlier, and set up equals to Allah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while! You will certainly be one of the inmates of the Fire.” </li>
          <li>Quran 42-48: But if they turn away, We have not sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a keeper over them. Your duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺. And indeed, when We let someone taste a mercy from Us, they become prideful ˹because˺ of it. But when afflicted with evil because of what their hands have done, then one becomes totally ungrateful.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 46-26: Indeed, We had established them1 in a way We have not established you ˹Meccans˺. And We gave them hearing, sight, and intellect. But neither their hearing, sight, nor intellect were of any benefit to them whatsoever, since they persisted in denying Allah’s signs. And ˹so˺ they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
          <li>Quran 48-11: The nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, will say to you ˹O Prophet˺, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Who then can stand between you and Allah in any way, if He intends harm or benefit for you? In fact, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 61-2, 3: O believers! Why do you say what you do not do? How despicable it is in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do! </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 73: The foolish bhikkhu desires praise for qualities he does not have, precedence among
            bhikkhus, authority in the monasteries, and veneration from those unrelated to him.

            Verse 74: "Let both laymen and bhikkhus think that things are done because of me; let them obey me in all
            matters, great and small." Such being the thoughts of the fool, his greed and his pride grow.</li>
          <li>The Story or Bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka: "Tell those bhikkhus not to destroy the faith and
            generosity of the lay disciples by misconduct and if anyone should disobey, drive him out of the
            monastery. Do not hesitate to do as I told you, for only fools dislike being given good advice and being
            forbidden to do evil."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: "It is in the nature of the foolish to be full of sorrow and feel
            depressed when things go wrong, and to be full of gladness and feel elated when things go well. The wise,
            however, can withstand the ups and downs of life."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Son of Mahadhana: "Ananda, look at this son of a very rich man; he had lived a useless

            he would have been a top-ranking rich man; or if he had become a bhikkhu, he could have been an arahat, and
            his wife could have been an anagami. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the second stage of his
            life he would have been a second rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been an anagami,
            and his wife could have been a sakadagami. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the third stage of
            his life he would have been a third rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been a
            sakadagami, and his wife could have been a sotapanna. However, because he had done nothing in all the three
            stages of his life he had lost all his worldly riches, he had also lost all opportunities of attaining any
            of the Maggas and Phalas."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 162: As the creeper (maluva) strangle the sal tree, so also, a really immoral person
            (overwhelmed by Craving) does to himself just what his enemy wishes him to do. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 164: The foolish man who, on account of his wrong views, scorns the teaching of
            homage-worthy Noble Ones (Ariyas) who live according to the Dhamma is like the bamboo which bears fruit for
            its own destruction. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada: Verse 177: Indeed, misers do not go to the abode of the devas; fools do not praise charity;
            but the wise rejoice in charity and so gain happiness in the life hereafter. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 207: He who walks in the company of fools has to grieve for a long time. Association with
            fools is ever painful, as living with an enemy; association with the wise is a pleasure, as living with
            relatives.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Group of Six Bhikkhus: When the Buddha was told about this, he said, "Bhikkhus! I do not
            say that one who talks much, abuses and bullies others is a wise man. Only he who is free from hatred, and
            harms no one is a wise man."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 286: "Here will I live in the rainy season; here will I live in the cold season and the
            hot season", so imagines the fool, not realizing the danger (of approaching death). </li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Khema: The Buddha knowing the state of her mind remarked, "O Khema! Look carefully at
            this decaying body which is built around a skeleton of bones and is subject to disease and decay. Look
            carefully at the body which is thought of so highly by the foolish. Look at the worthlessness of the beauty
            of this young girl." After hearing this, Queen Khema attained Sotapatti Fruition</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 355: Wealth destroys the foolish; but it cannot destroy those who seek the other shore
            (i.e., Nibbana). By his craving for wealth the fool destroys himself, as he would destroy others. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 394: O foolish one! What is the use of wearing matted hair? What is the use of your
            wearing a garment made of antelope skin? In you, there is a forest (of moral defilements); you clean
            yourself only externally.</li>

          <li>Quran 3-151: We will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers for associating ˹false gods˺ with Allah—a practice He has never authorized. The Fire will be their home—what an evil place for the wrongdoers to stay! </li>

          <li>Quran 10-21: When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a hardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is swifter in devising ˹punishment˺. Surely Our messenger-angels record whatever you devise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-8: And if We delay their punishment until an appointed time, they will definitely say, “What is holding it back?” Indeed, on the Day it overtakes them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-46: They devised every plot, which was fully known to Allah, but their plotting was not enough to ˹even˺ overpower mountains ˹let alone Allah˺. </li>

          <li>Quran 28-81:  Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor could he even help himself. </li>

          <li>Quran 33-57: Surely those who offend Allah1 and His Messenger2 are condemned by Allah in this world and the Hereafter. And He has prepared for them a humiliating punishment.</li>

          <li>Quran 40-83: When their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were prideful in whatever ˹worldly˺ knowledge they had,1 and were ˹ultimately˺ overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
          <li>Quran 41-17: As for Thamûd, We showed them guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. So the blast of a disgracing punishment overtook them for what they used to commit. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-47, 48: But as soon as he came to them with Our signs, they laughed at them, although every sign We showed them was greater than the one before.1 Ultimately, We seized them with torments so that they might return ˹to the Right Path˺.2</li>
          <li>Quran 46-24: Then when they saw the torment as a ˹dense˺ cloud approaching their valleys, they said ˹happily˺, “This is a cloud bringing us rain.” ˹But Hûd replied,˺ “No, it is what you sought to hasten: a ˹fierce˺ wind carrying a painful punishment!” </li>
          <li>Quran 49-16: Say, “Do you inform Allah of your faith, when Allah ˹already˺ knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth? And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.” </li>
          <li>Quran 52-38: Or do they have a stairway, by which they eavesdrop ˹on the heavens˺? Then let those who do so bring a compelling proof. </li>
          <li>Quran 52-44: If they were to see a ˹deadly˺ piece of the sky fall down ˹upon them˺, still they would say, “˹This is just˺ a pile of clouds.” </li>

          <li>Quran 74-48, ..., 56: So the pleas of intercessors will be of no benefit to them. Now, what is the matter with them that they are turning away from the reminder, as if they were spooked zebras fleeing from a lion? In fact, each one of them wishes to be given a ˹personal˺ letter ˹from Allah˺ for all ˹to read˺.1 But no! In fact, they do not fear the Hereafter. Enough! Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder So let whoever wills be mindful of it. But they cannot do so unless Allah wills. He ˹alone˺ is worthy to be feared and entitled to forgive. </li>

          <li>Quran 2-75: Do you ˹believers still˺ expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it? </li>
          <li>Quran 2-126: And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city ˹of Mecca˺ secure and provide fruits to its people—those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” He answered, “As for those who disbelieve, I will let them enjoy themselves for a little while, then I will condemn them to the torment of the Fire. What an evil destination!” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-75: There are some among the People of the Book who, if entrusted with a stack of gold, will readily return it. Yet there are others who, if entrusted with a single coin, will not repay it unless you constantly demand it. This is because they say, “We are not accountable for ˹exploiting˺ the Gentiles.”1 And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-79: It is not appropriate for someone who Allah has blessed with the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood to say to people, “Worship me instead of Allah.” Rather, he would say, “Be devoted to the worship of your Lord ˹alone˺”—in accordance with what these prophets read in the Scripture and what they taught. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-119: Here you are! You love them but they do not love you, and you believe in all Scriptures. When they meet you they say, “We believe.” But when alone, they bite their fingertips in rage. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹May you˺ die of your rage!” Surely Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-188: Do not let those who rejoice in their misdeeds and love to take credit for what they have not done think they will escape torment. They will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-18: However, repentance is not accepted from those who knowingly persist in sin until they start dying, and then cry, “Now I repent!” nor those who die as disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-49: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who ˹falsely˺ elevate themselves? It is Allah who elevates whoever He wills. And none will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-60: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who claim they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They seek the judgment of false judges, which they were commanded to reject. And Satan ˹only˺ desires to lead them farther away. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-81: And they say, “We obey,” but when they leave you, a group of them would spend the night contradicting what they said. Allah records all their schemes. So turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-28: But no! ˹They only say this˺ because the truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. Even if they were to be sent back, they would certainly revert to what they were forbidden. Indeed they are liars! </li>
          <li>Quran 6-81: And how should I fear your associate-gods, while you have no fear in associating ˹others˺ with Allah—a practice He has never authorized? Which side has more right to security? ˹Tell me˺ if you really know!” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-56: ˹namely˺ those with whom you ˹O Prophet˺ have entered into treaties, but they violate them every time, not fearing the consequences. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-48: They had already sought to spread discord before1 and devised every ˹possible˺ plot against you ˹O Prophet˺, until the truth came and Allah’s Will prevailed—much to their dismay. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-33: And so your Lord’s decree has been proven true against the rebellious—that they will never believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-39: In fact, they ˹hastily˺ rejected the Book without comprehending it and before the fulfilment of its warnings. Similarly, those before them were in denial. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers! </li>
          <li>Quran 10-42, 43, 44: Some of them listen to what you say, but can you make the deaf hear even though they do not understand? And some of them look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they cannot see?1 Indeed, Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-77:  Moses responded, “Is this what you say about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? Magicians will never succeed.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-10: But if We give them a taste of prosperity after being touched with adversity, they say, “My ills are gone,” and become totally prideful and boastful, </li>
          <li>Quran 11-48: It was said, “O Noah! Disembark with Our peace and blessings on you and some of the descendants of those with you. As for the others, We will allow them ˹a brief˺ enjoyment, then they will be touched with a painful punishment from Us.” </li>
          <li>Quran 12-25: They raced for the door and she tore his shirt from the back, only to find her husband at the door. She cried, “What is the penalty for someone who tried to violate your wife, except imprisonment or a painful punishment?” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-5: ˹Now,˺ if anything should amaze you ˹O Prophet˺, then it is their question: “When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new creation?” It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord. It is they who will have shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-21: They are dead, not alive—not even knowing when their followers will be resurrected. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-36: We surely sent a messenger to every community, saying, “Worship Allah and shun false gods.” But some of them were guided by Allah, while others were destined to stray. So travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers! </li>
          <li>Quran 16-86: And when the polytheists see their associate-gods, they will say, “Our Lord! These are our associate-gods that we used to invoke besides You.” Their gods will throw a rebuttal at them, ˹saying,˺ “You are definitely liars.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-106, 107: Whoever disbelieves in Allah after their belief—not those who are forced while their hearts are firm in faith,1 but those who embrace disbelief wholeheartedly—they will be condemned by Allah and suffer a tremendous punishment. This is because they prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter. Surely Allah never guides those who ˹choose to˺ disbelieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-2, 3:  Whatever new reminder comes to them from their Lord, they only listen to it jokingly, with their hearts ˹totally˺ distracted. The evildoers would converse secretly, ˹saying,˺ “Is this ˹one˺ not human like yourselves? Would you fall for ˹this˺ witchcraft, even though you can ˹clearly˺ see?” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-71: Yet they worship besides Allah that for which He has sent down no authority, and of which they have no knowledge. The wrongdoers will have no helper. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-31: And they exclaimed, “If only this Quran was revealed to a great man from ˹one of˺ the two cities!”1</li>
          <li>Quran 43-49, 50: ˹Then˺ they pleaded, “O ˹mighty˺ magician! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you.1 We will certainly accept guidance.” But as soon as We removed the torments from them, they broke their promise. </li>
          <li>Quran 43-53: Why then have no golden bracelets ˹of kingship˺ been granted to him or angels come with him as escorts!” </li>

          question the thera answered, "Whether the clothing is long or short, coarse or fine matters not to me; I am
          not at all attached to it."</li>

    <h4>The prophets on evil deeds</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 71: An evil deed does not immediately bear fruit, just as the newly-drawn milk does not
          curdle at once; but it follows the fool burning him like live coal covered with ashes. </li>
        <li>The Story of Three Groups of Persons: The Buddha answer to the first group: "Bhikkhus, once there was a
          farmer who had an ox. The ox was very lazy and also very stubborn. It could not be coaxed to do any work; it
          would lie down chewing the cud or else go to sleep. The farmer lost his temper many times on account of this
          lazy, stubborn animal; so in anger he tied a straw rope round the neck of the ox and set fire to it, and the
          ox died. On account of this evil deed the, farmer had suffered for a long time in niraya, and in serving out
          the remaining part of his punishment, he had been burnt to death in the last seven existences."

          The Buddha's answer to the second group: "Bhikkhus, once there was a woman who had a pet dog. She used to take
          the dog along with her wherever she went and young boys of the city poked fun at her. She was very angry and
          felt so ashamed that she planned to kill the dog. She filled a pot with sand, tied it round the neck of the
          dog and threw it into the water; and the dog was drowned. On account of this evil deed that woman had suffered
          for a long time in niraya and in serving the remaining part of her punishment, she had been thrown into the
          water to drown in the last one hundred existences."

          The Buddha's answer to the third group: "Bhikkhus, once, seven cowherds saw an iguana going into a mound and
          they dosed all the seven outlets of the mound with twigs and branches of trees. After closing the outlets they
          went away, completely forgetting the iguana that was trapped in the mound. Only after seven days, they
          remembered what they had done and hurriedly returned to the scene of their mischief and let out the iguana. On
          account of this evil deed, those seven had been imprisoned together for seven days without any food, in the
          last fourteen existences."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 127: Not in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean, nor in the cave of a mountain, nor
          anywhere else, is there a place, where one may escape from the consequences of an evil deed. </li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Kondadhana: The bhikkhus then reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha sent for
          Kodadadhana and said to him, "My son, did you see any woman with the other bhikkhus that you have talked to
          them thus? You have not seen any woman with them as they have seen one with you. I see that you do not realize
          that you have been cursed on account of an evil deed done by you in a past existence. Now listen, I shall
          explain to you why you have an image of a woman following you about.

          "You were a deva in your last existence. During that time, there were two bhikkhus who were very much attached
          to each other. But you tried to create trouble between the two, by assuming the appearance of a woman and
          following one of the bhikkhus. For that evil deed you are now being followed by the image of a woman. So, my
          son, in future do not argue with other bhikkhus any more; keep silent like a gong with the rim broken off and
          you will realize Nibbana."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 137: He who does harm with weapons to those who are harmless and should not be harmed will
          soon come to any of these ten evil consequences:
          Verses 138, 139 & 140: He will be subject to severe pain, or impoverishment, or injury to the body (i.e., loss
          of limbs), or serious illness (e.g., leprosy), or lunacy, or misfortunes following the wrath of the king, or
          wrongful and serious accusations, or loss of relatives, or destruction of wealth, or the burning down of his
          houses by fire or by lightning. After the dissolution of his body, the fool will be reborn in the plane of
          continuous suffering (niraya).</li>
        <li>The Story of Bodhirajakumara: In one of their past existences, the prince and his wife were the sole
          survivors of a shipwreck. They were stranded on a deserted island, and there they lived by eating birds' eggs,
          fledglings and birds, without any feeling of remorse at any time. For that evil deed, they would not be
          blessed with any children. If they had felt even a slight remorse for their deed at any stage of their lives,
          they could have a child or two in this existence. Then turning to the prince, the Buddha said, "One who loves
          himself should guard himself in all stages of life, or at least, during one stage in his life."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 161: The evil done by oneself, arising in oneself, and caused by oneself, destroys the
          foolish one, just as a diamond grinds the rock from which it is formed. </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verses 246 & 247: He who destroys life, tells lies, takes what is not given him, commits adultery
          and takes intoxicating drinks, digs up his own roots even in this very life.
          Verse 248: Know this, O man! Not restraining oneself is evil; do not let greed and ill will subject you to
          prolonged misery.</li>
        <li>The Story of a Swine-Peta: Then the Buddha exhorted, "A bhikkhu should be calm and well-restrained in
          thought, word and deed."</li>
        <li>The Story of Those Who Suffered for Their Evil Deeds: On hearing the statement about those bhikkhus, the
          Buddha said, "During the time of Kassapa Buddha, those bhikkhus had done much evil. For those evil deeds they
          had suffered in niraya and now they are serving out the remaining term of suffering as petas."</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Sivali: To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! In a previous existence, Sivali was the
          son of a king who lost his kingdom to another king. In trying to regain their kingdom he had besieged the city
          on the advice of his mother. As a result, the people in the city were without food or water for seven days. It
          was for this evil deed that Sivali was imprisoned in his mother's womb for seven years. But now, Sivali has
          come to the end of all dukkha; he has realized Nibbana."</li>

          Quran 2-15: Allah will throw their mockery back at them, leaving them to continue wandering blindly in their
          defiance.
        </li>
        <li>Quran 2-81: But no! Those who commit evil and are engrossed in sin will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-117: The good they do in this worldly life is like the harvest of an evil people struck by a bitter wind, destroying it ˹completely˺. Allah never wronged them, but they wronged themselves. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-137: Similar situations came to pass before you, so travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-123: ˹Divine grace is˺ neither by your wishes nor those of the People of the Book! Whoever commits evil will be rewarded accordingly, and they will find no protector or helper besides Allah. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-33: Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.1</li>
        <li>Quran 6-120: Shun all sin—open and secret. Indeed, those who commit sin will be punished for what they earn. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-78: Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them, and they fell lifeless in their homes. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-146: I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-17: It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they openly profess disbelief. Their deeds are void, and they will be in the Fire forever. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-69: ˹You hypocrites are˺ like those ˹disbelievers˺ before you. They were far superior to you in might and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share in this life. You have enjoyed your share, just as they did. And you have engaged in idle talk, just as they did. Their deeds have become void in this world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-87: They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and their hearts have been sealed so they do not comprehend. </li>
        <li>Quran 10-27: As for those who commit evil, the reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. Humiliation will cover them—with no one to protect them from Allah—as if their faces were covered with patches of the night’s deep darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. </li>
        <li>Quran 13-34: For them is punishment in this worldly life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is truly far worse. And none can shield them from Allah. </li>
        <li>Quran 14-18: The parable of the deeds of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that of ashes fiercely blown away by wind on a stormy day. They will gain nothing from what they have earned. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can stray. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-34:  Then the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds overtook them, and they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
        <li>Quran 19-79: Not at all! We certainly record whatever he claims and will increase his punishment extensively. </li>
        <li>Quran 19-86: and drive the wicked to Hell like a thirsty herd. </li>
        <li>Quran 20-61, 62: Moses warned the magicians, “Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against Allah,1 or He will wipe you out with a torment. Whoever fabricates ˹lies˺ is bound to fail.” So the magicians disputed the matter among themselves, conversing privately. </li>
        <li>Quran 20-97: Moses said, “Go away then! And for ˹the rest of your˺ life you will surely be crying, ‘Do not touch ˹me˺!’1 Then you will certainly have a fate2 that you cannot escape. Now look at your god to which you have been devoted: we will burn it up, then scatter it in the sea completely.” </li>
        <li>Quran 24-23, 24: Surely those who accuse chaste, unsuspecting,1 believing women are cursed in this life and the Hereafter. And they will suffer a tremendous punishment on the Day their tongues, hands, and feet will testify against them for what they used to do. </li>
        <li>Quran 27-90: And whoever comes with an evil deed will be hurled face-first into the Fire. Are you rewarded except for what you used to do? </li>
        <li>Quran 29-68: And who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or reject the truth after it has reached them? Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the disbelievers? </li>
        <li>Quran 31-13: And ˹remember˺ when Luqmân said to his son, while advising him, “O my dear son! Never associate ˹anything˺ with Allah ˹in worship˺, for associating ˹others with Him˺ is truly the worst of all wrongs.” </li>
        <li>Quran 32-22: And who does more wrong than the one who is reminded of Allah’s revelations then turns away from them? We will surely inflict punishment upon the wicked. </li>
        <li>Quran 39-32: Who then does more wrong than those who lie about Allah and reject the truth after it has reached them? Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the disbelievers? </li>
        <li>Quran 39-48:  And the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds will unfold before them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
        <li>Quran 39-51: So the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds overtook them. And the wrongdoers among these ˹pagans˺ will be overtaken by the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds. And they will have no escape. </li>
        <li>Quran 39-65: It has already been revealed to you—and to those ˹prophets˺ before you—that if you associate others ˹with Allah˺, your deeds will certainly be void and you will truly be one of the losers. </li>
        <li>Quran 40-36, 37: Pharaoh ordered, “O Hamân! Build me a high tower so I may reach the pathways leading up to the heavens and look for the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.”1 And so Pharaoh’s evil deeds were made so appealing to him that he was hindered from the ˹Right˺ Way. But the plotting of Pharaoh was only in vain. </li>
        <li>Quran 42-30: Whatever affliction befalls you is because of what your own hands have committed. And He pardons much. </li>
        <li>Quran 42-40: The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. But whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, then their reward is with Allah. He certainly does not like the wrongdoers. </li>
        <li>Quran 43-39: ˹It will be said to both,˺ “Since you all did wrong, sharing in the punishment will be of no benefit to you this Day.”1  </li>
        <li>Quran 45-33: And the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds will unfold before them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
        <li>Quran 47-1: Those who disbelieve and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, He will render their deeds void. </li>
        <li>Quran 47-32: Indeed, those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and defy the Messenger after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them; they will not harm Allah in the least, but He will render their deeds void. </li>
        <li>Quran 52-47: Also, the wrongdoers will certainly have another torment before that ˹Day˺, but most of them do not know.1</li>
        <li>Quran 61-7: Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies about Allah when invited to submit ˹to Him˺?1 For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. </li>
        <li>Quran 63-2: They have made their ˹false˺ oaths as a shield, hindering ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah. Evil indeed is what they do! </li>
        <li>Quran 63-7: They are the ones who say ˹to one another˺, “Do not spend ˹anything˺ on those ˹emigrants˺ with the Messenger of Allah so that they will break away ˹from him˺.” But to Allah ˹alone˺ belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, yet the hypocrites do not comprehend. </li>
        <li>Quran 64-5: Have the stories of those who disbelieved before not reached you ˹pagans˺? They tasted the evil consequences of their doings, and they will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
        <li>Quran 65-9: So they tasted the evil consequences of their doings, and the outcome of their doings was ˹total˺ loss. </li>

    <h4>The prophets on the hereafter</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 1: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they
          are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, 'dukkha' 3 follows him just as the wheel follows the
          hoofprint of the ox that draws the cart.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 15: Here he grieves, hereafter he grieves; the evil-doer grieves in both existences. He
          grieves and he suffers anguish when he sees the depravity of his own deeds.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 17: Here he is tormented, hereafter he is tormented; the evil-doer is tormented in both
          existences. He is tormented, and he laments: "Evil have I done." He is even more tormented when he is reborn
          in one of the lower worlds (Apaya).</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 21: Mindfulness is the way to the Deathless (Nibbana); unmindfulness is the way to Death.
          Those who are mindful do not die; those who are not mindful are as if already dead.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Seyyasaka: Then, the Buddha added, "This kind of offence can only lead to evil results in
          this world as well as in the next."</li>
        <li>The Story of an Anagami Thera: The Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Your teacher, who was an Anagami before he
          passed away, is now reborn in the abodes of the Brahmas (Suddhavasa Brahmaloka). He did not reveal his
          attainment of Anagami Magga because he felt ashamed that he had achieved only that much, and he was ardently
          striving to attain arahatship. Your teacher is now freed from the attachment to the sensual world (kamaloka)
          and would certainly rise to higher realms."</li>
        <li>The Story of the Brahmin who had been the 'Father of the Buddha': The Buddha then replied, "Bhikkhus, they
          called me son because I was a son or a nephew to each of them for one thousand five hundred existences in the
          past." </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 306: One who tells lies (about others) goes to niraya; one who has done evil and says "I
          did not do it" also goes to niraya. Both of them being evil-doers, suffer alike (in niraya) in their next
          existence.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 318: Beings who imagine wrong in what is not wrong, who do not see wrong in what is wrong,
          and who hold wrong views go to a lower plane of existence (duggati).
          Verse 319: Beings who know what is wrong as wrong. who know what is right as right, and who hold right views
          go to a happy plane of existence (suggati).</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Santakaya: It is said that lions usually go out in search of food one day and then rest
          in a cave for the next seven days without moving. Thera Santakaya, having been a lion in his last existence,
          behaved very much like a lion. He moved about very little; his moments were slow and steady; and he was
          usually calm and composed. Other bhikkhus took his behaviour to be very queer and they reported about him to
          the Buddha.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Vangisa: The Buddha, knowing their intention, instructed the bhikkhus to bring the skulls
          of a person reborn in niraya, of a person reborn in the animal world, of a person reborn in the human world,
          of a person reborn in the deva world and also of an arahat. The five were then placed in a row. When Vangisa
          was shown those skulls he could tell where the owners of the first four skulls were reborn but when he came to
          the skull of the arahat he was at a loss. </li>

        <li>Quran 2-56: Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that perhaps you would be grateful. </li>
        <li>Quran 2-114: Who does more wrong than those who prevent Allah’s Name from being mentioned in His places of worship and strive to destroy them? Such people have no right to enter these places except with fear.1 For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-15: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall I inform you of what is better than ˹all of˺ this? Those mindful ˹of Allah˺ will have Gardens with their Lord under which rivers flow, to stay there forever, and pure spouses,1 along with Allah’s pleasure.” And Allah is All-Seeing of ˹His˺ servants, </li>
        <li>Quran 3-30: ˹Watch for˺ the Day when every soul will be presented with whatever good it has done. And it will wish that its misdeeds were far off. And Allah warns you about Himself. And Allah is Ever Gracious to ˹His˺ servants. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-56: As for those who disbelieve, I will subject them to a severe punishment in this life and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-77: Indeed, those who trade Allah’s covenant and their oaths for a fleeting gain will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them, nor purify them on the Day of Judgment. And they will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-180: And do not let those who ˹greedily˺ withhold Allah’s bounties think it is good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed ˹by their necks˺ on the Day of Judgment with whatever ˹wealth˺ they used to withhold. And Allah is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-56: Surely those who reject Our signs, We will cast them into the Fire. Whenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it so they will ˹constantly˺ taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-145: Surely the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire—and you will never find for them any helper— </li>
        <li>Quran 6-32: This worldly life is no more than play and amusement, but far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?</li>
        <li>Quran 7-38: Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with the ˹evil˺ groups of jinn and humans that preceded you.” Whenever a group enters Hell, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord! They have misled us, so multiply their torment in the Fire.” He will answer, “It has already been multiplied for all, but you do not know.” </li>
        <li>Quran 7-41: Hell will be their bed; flames will be their cover. This is how We reward the wrongdoers. </li>
        <li>Quran 8-14: That ˹worldly punishment˺ is yours, so taste it! Then the disbelievers will suffer the torment of the Fire. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-35: The Day ˹will come˺ when their treasure will be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, sides, and backs branded with it. ˹It will be said to them,˺ “This is the treasure you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste what you hoarded!” </li>
        <li>Quran 9-63: Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will be in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-94: They will make excuses to you ˹believers˺ when you return to them. Say, “Make no excuses, ˹for˺ we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us about your ˹true˺ state ˹of faith˺. Your ˹future˺ deeds will be observed by Allah and His Messenger as well. And you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.” </li>
        <li>Quran 10-52: Then the wrongdoers will be told, “Taste the torment of eternity! Are you not rewarded except for what you used to commit?” </li>
        <li>Quran 11-16: It is they who will have nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. Their efforts in this life will be fruitless and their deeds will be useless. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-17: ˹Can these people be compared to˺ those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear proof from their Lord, backed by ˹the Quran as˺ a witness from Him, and preceded by the Book of Moses ˹which was revealed˺ as a guide and mercy? It is those ˹believers˺ who have faith in it. But whoever from the ˹disbelieving˺ groups rejects it, the Fire will be their destiny. So do not be in doubt of it. It is certainly the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-99: They were followed by a curse in this ˹life˺ and ˹will receive another˺ on the Day of Judgment. What an evil gift to receive! </li>
        <li>Quran 11-103: Surely in this is a sign for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which humanity will be gathered and a Day ˹that will be˺ witnessed ˹by all˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-107: staying there forever, as long as the heavens and the earth will endure, except what your Lord wills.1 Surely your Lord does what He intends. </li>
        <li>Quran 14-23: Those who believe and do good will be admitted into Gardens, under which rivers flow—to stay there forever by the Will of their Lord—where they will be greeted with “Peace!” </li>
        <li>Quran 16-29: So enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever. Indeed, what an evil home for the arrogant!” </li>
        <li>Quran 16-38, 39: They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that Allah will never raise the dead to life. Yes ˹He will˺! It is a true promise binding on Him, but most people do not know. ˹He will do that˺ to make clear to them what they disagreed on, and for the disbelievers to know that they were liars. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-41: As for those who emigrated in ˹the cause of˺ Allah after being persecuted, We will surely bless them with a good home in this world. But the reward of the Hereafter is far better, if only they knew. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-84: ˹Consider, O  Prophet,˺ the Day We will call ˹a prophet as˺ a witness from every faith-community. Then the disbelievers will neither be allowed to plead nor appease ˹their Lord˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-111: ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ every soul will come pleading for itself, and each will be paid in full for what it did, and none will be wronged. </li>
        <li>Quran 17-21: See how We have favoured some over others ˹in this life˺, but the Hereafter is certainly far greater in rank and in favour. </li>
        <li>Quran 17-49, 50, 51, 52:  And they say ˹mockingly˺, “When we are reduced to bones and ashes, will we really be raised as a new creation?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Yes, even if˺ you become stones, or iron, or whatever you think is harder to bring to life!” Then they will ask ˹you˺, “Who will bring us back ˹to life˺?” Say, “The One Who created you the first time.” They will then shake their heads at you and ask, “When will that be?” Say, “Perhaps it is soon!” On the Day He will call you, you will ˹instantly˺ respond by praising Him,1 thinking you had remained ˹in the world˺ only for a little while. </li>
        <li>Quran 17-97: Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, you will find no guardians for them besides Him. And We will drag them on their faces on the Day of Judgment—deaf, dumb, and blind. Hell will be their home. Whenever it dies down, We will flare it up for them. </li>
        <li>Quran 18-29: And say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord. Whoever wills let them believe, and whoever wills let them disbelieve.” Surely We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will ˹completely˺ surround them. When they cry for aid, they will be aided with water like molten metal, which will burn ˹their˺ faces. What a horrible drink! And what a terrible place to rest! </li>
        <li>Quran 18-31: It is they who will have the Gardens of Eternity, with rivers flowing under their feet. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade, reclining there on ˹canopied˺ couches. What a marvellous reward! And what a fabulous place to rest</li>
        <li>Quran 18-53: The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no way to avoid it. </li>
        <li>Quran 19-68, 69, 70, 71, 72: By your Lord ˹O Prophet˺! We will surely gather them along with the devils, and then set them around Hell on their knees.  Then We will certainly begin by dragging out of every group the ones most defiant to the Most Compassionate. And We truly know best who is most deserving of burning in it. There is none of you who will not pass over it.1 ˹This is˺ a decree your Lord must fulfil. Then We will deliver those who were devout, leaving the wrongdoers there on their knees. </li>
        <li>Quran 20-55: From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will bring you back again. 
        <li>Quran 20-102: ˹Beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown,1 and We will gather the wicked on that Day blue-faced ˹from horror and thirst˺.2</li>
        <li>Quran 21-39: If only the disbelievers knew that a time will come when they will not be able to keep the Fire off their faces or backs, nor will they be helped. </li>
        <li>Quran 21-98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103:  Certainly you ˹disbelievers˺ and whatever you worship instead of Allah will be the fuel of Hell.1 You are ˹all˺ bound to enter it.  Had those idols been ˹true˺ gods, they would not have entered it. And they will be there forever.  In it they will groan, and will not be able to hear.  Surely those for whom We have destined the finest reward will be kept far away from Hell,  not even hearing the slightest hissing from it. And they will delight forever in what their souls desire.  The Supreme Horror ˹of that Day˺ will not disturb them, and the angels will greet them, ˹saying,˺ “This is your Day, which you have been promised.” </li>
        <li>Quran 21-104: On that Day We will roll up the heavens like a scroll of writings. Just as We produced the first creation, ˹so˺ shall We reproduce it. That is a promise binding on Us. We truly uphold ˹Our promises˺!  Surely, following the ˹heavenly˺ Record, We decreed in the Scriptures: “My righteous servants shall inherit the land.”1 </li>
        <li>Quran 22-7: And certainly the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it. And Allah will surely resurrect those in the graves. </li>
        <li>Quran 22-19, 20: These are two opposing groups that disagree about their Lord: as for the disbelievers, garments of Fire will be cut out for them and boiling water will be poured over their heads, melting whatever is in their bellies, along with their skin. </li>
        <li>Quran 22-21, 22, 23, 24, 25: And awaiting them are maces of iron. Whenever they try to escape from Hell—out of anguish—they will be forced back into it, ˹and will be told,˺ “Taste the torment of burning!”  ˹But˺ Allah will surely admit those who believe and do good into Gardens, under which rivers flow, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk, for they have been guided to the best of speech, and they have been guided to the Commendable Path.1   Indeed, those who persist in disbelief and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah and from the Sacred Mosque1—which We have appointed for all people, residents and visitors alike—along with whoever intends to deviate by doing wrong in it,2 We will cause them to taste a painful punishment. </li>
        <li>Quran 22-66: And He is the One Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, and then will bring you back to life. ˹But˺ surely humankind is ever ungrateful. </li>
        <li>Quran 23-103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115: But those whose scale is light, they will have doomed themselves, staying in Hell forever. The Fire will burn their faces, leaving them deformed. ˹It will be said,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you, but you used to deny them?”  They will cry, “Our Lord! Our ill-fate took hold of us, so we became a misguided people.  Our Lord! Take us out of this ˹Fire˺. Then if we ever return ˹to denial˺, we will truly be wrongdoers.” Allah will respond, “Be despised in there! Do not ˹ever˺ plead with Me ˹again˺! Indeed, there was a group of My servants who used to pray, ‘Our Lord! We have believed, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of those who show mercy,’  but you were ˹so busy˺ making fun of them that it made you forget My remembrance. And you used to laugh at them. Today I have indeed rewarded them for their perseverance: they are certainly the triumphant.” He will ask ˹them˺, “How many years did you remain on earth?”  They will reply, “We remained ˹only˺ a day or part of a day.1 But ask those who kept count.” He will say, “You only remained for a little while, if only you knew. Did you then think that We had created you without purpose, and that you would never be returned to Us?” </li>
        <li>Quran 24-57: Do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that the disbelievers can escape in the land. The Fire will be their home. Indeed, what an evil destination! </li>
        <li>Quran 25-11, 12, 13, 14: In fact, they deny the Hour.1 And for the deniers of the Hour, We have prepared a blazing Fire. Once it sees them from a distance, they will hear it fuming and growling. And when they are tossed into a narrow place inside ˹Hell˺, chained together, then and there they will cry out for ˹instant˺ destruction. ˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry only once for destruction, but cry many times over!”</li>
        <li>Quran 25-17, 18, 19: ˹Watch for˺ the Day He will gather them along with what they used to worship besides Allah, and ask ˹the objects of worship˺,1 “Was it you who misled these servants of Mine, or did they stray from the Way ˹on their own˺?” They will say, “Glory be to You! It was not right for ˹others like˺ us to take any lords besides You,1 but You allowed enjoyment for them and their forefathers ˹for so long˺ that they forgot ˹Your˺ remembrance and became a doomed people.” ˹The doomed will be told˺, “Your gods have clearly denied your claims. So now you can neither ward off ˹the punishment˺ nor get any help.” And whoever of you does wrong, We will make them taste a horrible punishment. </li>
        <li>Quran 25-22, 23: ˹But˺ on the Day they will see the angels, there will be no good news for the wicked, who will cry, “Keep away! Away ˹from us˺!”1 Then We will turn to whatever ˹good˺ deeds they did, reducing them to scattered dust.1</li>
        <li>Quran 25-25, 26, 27, 28 29: ˹Watch for˺ the Day the heavens will burst with clouds, and the angels will be sent down in successive ranks. True authority on that Day will belong ˹only˺ to the Most Compassionate.1 And it will be a hard day for the disbelievers. And ˹beware of˺ the Day the wrongdoer will bite his nails ˹in regret˺ and say, “Oh! I wish I had followed the Way along with the Messenger! Woe to me! I wish I had never taken so-and-so as a close friend. It was he who truly made me stray from the Reminder after it had reached me.” And Satan has always betrayed humanity. </li>
        <li>Quran 25-34: Those who will be dragged into Hell on their faces will be in the worst place, and are ˹now˺ farthest from the ˹Right˺ Way. </li>
        <li>Quran 25-69: Their punishment will be multiplied on the Day of Judgment, and they will remain in it forever, in disgrace. </li>
        <li>Quran 26-87, 88: And do not disgrace me on the Day all will be resurrected—  the Day when neither wealth nor children will be of any benefit. </li>
        <li>Quran 26-94, 95, 96, 97, 98: Then the idols will be hurled headlong into Hell, along with the deviant  and the soldiers of Iblîs,1 all together.  There the deviant will cry while disputing with their idols, “By Allah! We were clearly mistaken,  when we made you equal to the Lord of all worlds. </li>
        <li>Quran 27-87: And ˹beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and all those in the heavens and all those on the earth will be horrified ˹to the point of death˺,1 except those Allah wills ˹to spare˺. And all will come before Him, fully humbled. </li>
        <li>Quran 28-63: Those ˹misleaders˺ against whom the decree ˹of torment˺ is justified will cry, “Our Lord! These ˹followers˺ are the ones we caused to deviate. We led them into deviance, for we ourselves were deviant. We disassociate ourselves ˹from them˺ before You. It was not us that they used to worship.” </li>
        <li>Quran 29-55: on the Day the punishment will overwhelm them from above them and from below their feet. And it will be said, “Reap what you sowed.” </li>
        <li>Quran 30-55: And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will swear that they did not stay ˹in this world˺ more than an hour. In this way they were always deluded ˹in the world˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 32-13: Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on every soul. But My Word will come to pass: I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together. </li>
        <li>Quran 32-20: But as for those who are rebellious, the Fire will be their home. Whenever they try to escape from it, they will be forced back into it, and will be told, “Taste the Fire’s torment, which you used to deny.” </li>
        <li>Quran 33-66: On the Day their faces are ˹constantly˺ flipped in the Fire, they will cry, “Oh! If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!”</li>
        <li>Quran 34-30: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “A Day has ˹already˺ been appointed for you, which you can neither delay nor advance by a ˹single˺ moment.” </li>
        <li>Quran 34-31, 32: The disbelievers vow, “We will never believe in this Quran, nor in those ˹Scriptures˺ before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers will be detained before their Lord, throwing blame at each other! The lowly ˹followers˺ will say to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers.”  The arrogant will respond to the lowly, “Did we ever hinder you from guidance after it came to you? In fact, you were wicked ˹on your own˺.” </li>
        <li>Quran 34-33: The lowly will say to the arrogant, “No! It was your plotting by day and night—when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up equals with Him.” They will ˹all˺ hide ˹their˺ remorse when they see the torment. And We will put shackles around the necks of the disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they used to do? </li>
        <li>Quran 34-51, ..., 54: If only you could see when they will be horrified with no escape ˹on Judgment Day˺! And they will be seized from a nearby place.1 They will ˹then˺ cry, “We do ˹now˺ believe in it ˹all˺.” But how could they ˹possibly˺ attain faith from a place so far-off ˹from the world˺,1 while they had already rejected it before, guessing blindly from a place ˹equally˺ far-away ˹from the Hereafter˺? They will be sealed off from whatever they desire, as was done to their counterparts before. Indeed, they were ˹all˺ in alarming doubt. </li>
        <li>Quran 35-14: If you call upon them, they cannot hear your calls. And if they were to hear, they could not respond to you. On the Day of Judgment they will disown your worship ˹of them˺. And no one can inform you ˹O Prophet˺ like the All-Knowledgeable. </li>
        <li>Quran 35-33, 34, 35: They will enter the Gardens of Eternity, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk.  And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, Who has kept away from us all ˹causes of˺ sorrow. Our Lord is indeed All-Forgiving, Most Appreciative. ˹He is the One˺ Who—out of His grace—has settled us in the Home of Everlasting Stay, where we will be touched by neither fatigue nor weariness.” </li>
        <li>Quran 35-36, 37: As for the disbelievers, they will have the Fire of Hell, where they will not be ˹allowed to be˺ finished by death, nor will its torment be lightened for them. This is how We reward every ˹stubborn˺ disbeliever. There they will be ˹fervently˺ screaming, “Our Lord! Take us out ˹and send us back˺. We will do good, unlike what we used to do.” ˹They will be told,˺ “Did We not give you lives long enough so that whoever wanted to be mindful could have done so? And the warner came to you. So taste ˹the punishment˺, for the wrongdoers have no helper.” </li>
        <li>Quran 36-55, ..., 58: Indeed, on that Day the residents of Paradise will be busy enjoying themselves. They and their spouses will be in ˹cool˺ shade, reclining on ˹canopied˺ couches.  There they will have fruits and whatever they desire. And “Peace!” will be ˹their˺ greeting from the Merciful Lord. </li>
        <li>Quran 36-59, 60, 61: ˹Then the disbelievers will be told,˺ “Step away ˹from the believers˺ this Day, O  wicked ones! Did I not command you, O  Children of Adam, not to follow Satan, for he is truly your sworn enemy, but to worship Me ˹alone˺? This is the Straight Path. </li>
        <li>Quran 37-21: ˹They will be told,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision which you used to deny.” </li>
        <li>Quran 37-48, ..., 57: And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and gorgeous eyes, as if they were pristine pearls.1  Then they will turn to one another inquisitively.1 One of them will say, “I once had a companion ˹in the world˺ who used to ask ˹me˺, ‘Do you actually believe ˹in resurrection˺? When we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be brought to judgment?’” He will ˹then˺ ask, “Would you care to see ˹his fate˺?” Then he ˹and the others˺ will look and spot him in the midst of the Hellfire. He will ˹then˺ say, “By Allah! You nearly ruined meHad it not been for the grace of my Lord, I ˹too˺ would have certainly been among those brought ˹to Hell˺.”  </li>
        <li>Quran 37-62, ..., 68: Is this ˹bliss˺ a better accommodation or the tree of Zaqqûm?1  We have surely made it a test for the wrongdoers. Indeed, it is a tree that grows in the depths of Hell, bearing fruit like devils’ heads. The evildoers will certainly ˹be left to˺ eat from it, filling up their bellies with it. Then on top of that they will be given a blend of boiling drink. Then they will ultimately return to ˹their place in˺ Hell. </li>
        <li>Quran 37-143, 144: Had he not ˹constantly˺ glorified ˹Allah˺,1 he would have certainly remained in its belly until the Day of Resurrection.1 </li>
        <li>Quran 38-49, ..., 53: This is ˹all˺ a reminder. And the righteous will certainly have an honourable destination:  the Gardens of Eternity, whose gates will be open for them.  There they will recline, calling for abundant fruit and drink.  And with them will be maidens of modest gaze and equal age.  This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning. </li>
        <li>Quran 38-57: Let them then taste this: boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus, </li>
        <li>Quran 38-59, ..., 64: ˹The misleaders will say to one another,˺ “Here is a crowd ˹of followers˺ being thrown in with us. They are not welcome, ˹for˺ they ˹too˺ will burn in the Fire.”1  The followers will respond, “No! You are not welcome! You brought this upon us. What an evil place for settlement!”  Adding, “Our Lord! Whoever brought this upon us, double their punishment in the Fire.”  The tyrants will ask ˹one another˺, “But why do we not see those we considered to be lowly?  Were we wrong in mocking them ˹in the world˺?1 Or do our eyes ˹just˺ fail to see them ˹in the Fire˺?”  This dispute between the residents of the Fire will certainly come to pass. </li>
        <li>Quran 39-16: They will have layers of fire above and below them. That is what Allah warns His servants with. So fear Me, O  My servants! </li>
        <li>Quran 39-20: But those mindful of their Lord will have ˹elevated˺ mansions, built one above the other, under which rivers flow. ˹That is˺ the promise of Allah. ˹And˺ Allah never fails in ˹His˺ promise. </li>
        <li>Quran 39-26: So Allah made them taste humiliation in this worldly life, but far worse is the punishment of the Hereafter, if only they knew. </li>
        <li>Quran 39-60: On the Day of Judgment you will see those who lied about Allah with their faces gloomy. Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the arrogant? </li>
        <li>Quran 39-68, ..., 70: The Trumpet will be blown and all those in the heavens and all those on the earth will fall dead, except those Allah wills ˹to spare˺. Then it will be blown again and they will rise up at once, looking on ˹in anticipation˺. The earth1 will shine with the light of its Lord, the record ˹of deeds˺ will be laid ˹open˺, the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward—and judgment will be passed on all with fairness. None will be wronged.  Every soul will be paid in full for its deeds, for Allah knows best what they have done. </li>
        <li>Quran 39-71, 72: Those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in ˹successive˺ groups. When they arrive there, its gates will be opened and its keepers will ask them: “Did messengers not come to you from among yourselves, reciting to you the revelations of your Lord and warning you of the coming of this Day of yours?” The disbelievers will cry, “Yes ˹indeed˺! But the decree of torment has come to pass against the disbelievers.” It will be said to them, “Enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever.” What an evil home for the arrogant! </li>
        <li>Quran 39-73: And those who were mindful of their Lord will be led to Paradise in ˹successive˺ groups. When they arrive at its ˹already˺ open gates, its keepers will say, “Peace be upon you! You have done well, so come in, to stay forever.” </li>
        <li>Quran 40-10: Indeed, it will be announced to the disbelievers, “Allah’s contempt for you—as you disbelieved when invited to belief—was far worse than your contempt for one another ˹Today˺.” </li>
        <li>Quran 40-11: They will plead, “Our Lord! You made us lifeless twice, and gave us life twice.1 Now we confess our sins. So is there any way out?” </li>
        <li>Quran 40-18: Warn them ˹O Prophet˺ of the approaching Day when the hearts will jump into the throats, suppressing distress. The wrongdoers will have neither a close friend nor intercessor to be heard. </li>
        <li>Quran 40-46: they are exposed to the Fire ˹in their graves˺ morning and evening. And on the Day the Hour will be established ˹it will be said˺, “Admit Pharaoh’s people into the harshest punishment ˹of Hell˺.” </li>
        <li>Quran 40-47: ˹Consider the Day˺ when they will dispute in the Fire, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, will you then shield us from a portion of the Fire?” </li>
        <li>Quran 40-71, ..., 76: when shackles will be around their necks and chains ˹on their legs˺. They will be dragged through boiling water, then burned in the Fire ˹as fuel˺. Then they will be asked, “Where are those ˹idols˺ you used to associate with Allah?” They will cry, “They have ˹all˺ failed us. In fact, we did not invoke anything ˹real˺ before.” This is how Allah leaves the disbelievers to stray. ˹They will be told,˺ “This ˹punishment˺ is for being prideful on earth unjustly and for acting arrogantly. Enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever. What an evil home for the arrogant!” </li>
        <li>Quran 41-19, ..., 24: ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ the enemies of Allah will be gathered for the Fire, all driven in ranks. When they reach it, their ears, eyes, and skin will testify against what they used to do.1 They will ask their skin ˹furiously˺, “Why have you testified against us?” It will say, “We have been made to speak by Allah, Who causes all things to speak. He ˹is the One Who˺ created you the first time, and to Him you were bound to return. You did not ˹bother to˺ hide yourselves from your ears, eyes, and skin to prevent them from testifying against you. Rather, you assumed that Allah did not know much of what you used to do. It was that ˹false˺ assumption you entertained about your Lord that has brought about your doom, so you have become losers.”  Even if they endure patiently, the Fire will ˹always˺ be their home. And if they ˹beg to˺ appease ˹their Lord˺, they will never be allowed to. </li>
        <li>Quran 42-22: You will see the wrongdoers fearful ˹of the punishment˺ for what they committed but it will be inevitable for them, whereas those who believe and do good will be in the lush Gardens of Paradise. They will have whatever they desire from their Lord. That is ˹truly˺ the greatest bounty. </li>
        <li>Quran 42-44: And whoever Allah leaves to stray will have no guide after Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they face the torment, pleading, “Is there any way back ˹to the world˺?” </li>
        <li>Quran 42-45: And you will see them exposed to the Fire, fully humbled out of disgrace, stealing glances ˹at it˺. And the believers will say, “The ˹true˺ losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on Judgment Day.” The wrongdoers will certainly be in everlasting torment. </li>
        <li>Quran 43-71, ... 73: Golden trays and cups will be passed around to them. There will be whatever the souls desire and the eyes delight in. And you will be there forever. That is the Paradise which you will be awarded for what you used to do. There you will have abundant fruit1 to eat from. </li>
        <li>Quran 43-74, ..., 80: Indeed, the wicked will be in the torment of Hell forever. It will never be lightened for them, and there they will be overwhelmed with despair. We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the wrongdoers. They will cry, “O Mâlik!1 Let your Lord finish us off.” He will answer, “You are definitely here to stay.” We certainly brought the truth to you, but most of you were resentful of the truth. Or have they mastered some ˹evil˺ plan? Then We ˹too˺ are surely planning. Or do they think that We do not hear their ˹evil˺ thoughts and secret talks? Yes ˹We do˺! And Our messenger-angels are in their presence, recording ˹it all˺.  </li>
        <li>Quran 44-51, ..., 56: Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place,  amid Gardens and springs,  dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another.  So it will be. And We will pair them to maidens with gorgeous eyes.  There they will call for every fruit in serenity.  There they will never taste death, beyond the first death. And He will protect them from the punishment of the Hellfire— </li>
        <li>Quran 46-6: And when ˹such˺ people will be gathered together, those ˹gods˺ will be their enemies and will disown their worship. </li>
        <li>Quran 46-34: And on the Day the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire, ˹they will be asked,˺ “Is this ˹Hereafter˺ not the truth?” They will cry, “Absolutely, by our Lord!” It will be said, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.” </li>
        <li>Quran 47-34: Surely those who disbelieve, hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and then die as disbelievers; Allah will never forgive them. </li>
        <li>Quran 48-13: And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then We surely have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire. </li>
        <li>Quran 50-2: ˹All will be resurrected,˺ yet the deniers are astonished that a warner has come to them from among themselves ˹warning of resurrection˺. So the disbelievers say, “This is an astonishing thing! </li>
        <li>Quran 50-30: ˹Beware of˺ the Day We will ask Hell, “Are you full ˹yet˺?” And it will respond, “Are there any more?” </li>
        <li>Quran 50-41, 42: And listen! On the Day the caller will call out from a near place, the Day all will hear the ˹mighty˺ Blast in ˹all˺ truth,1 that will be the Day of emergence ˹from the graves˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 51-59: The wrongdoers will certainly have a share ˹of the torment˺ like that of their predecessors. So do not let them ask Me to hasten ˹it˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 52-12: those who amuse themselves with falsehood!  ˹It is˺ the Day they will be fiercely shoved into the Fire of Hell. </li>
        <li>Quran 52-22, ..., 28: And We will ˹continually˺ provide them with whatever fruit or meat they desire. They will pass around to each other a drink ˹of pure wine,˺ which leads to no idle talk or sinfulness. And they will be waited on by their youthful servants like spotless pearls.  They will turn to one another inquisitively.1  They will say, “Before ˹this reward˺ we used to be in awe ˹of Allah˺ in the midst of our people. So Allah has graced us and protected us from the torment of ˹Hell’s˺ scorching heat.  Indeed, we used to call upon Him ˹alone˺ before. He is truly the Most Kind, Most Merciful.”    </li>
        <li>Quran 55-44: They will alternate between its flames and scalding water.</li>
        <li>Quran 55-54: Those ˹believers˺ will recline on furnishings lined with rich brocade. And the fruit of both Gardens will hang within reach. </li>
        <li>Quran 55-56: In both ˹Gardens˺ will be maidens of modest gaze, who no human or jinn has ever touched before. </li>
        <li>Quran 55-58: Those ˹maidens˺ will be ˹as elegant˺ as rubies and coral. </li>
        <li>Quran 55-70: In all Gardens will be noble, pleasant mates. </li>
        <li>Quran 55-72: ˹They will be˺ maidens with gorgeous eyes, reserved in pavilions. </li>
        <li>Quran 55-76: All ˹believers˺ will be reclining on green cushions and splendid carpets. </li>
        <li>Quran 56-15, ..., 27: ˹All will be˺ on jewelled thrones, reclining face to face. They will be waited on by eternal youths with cups, pitchers, and a drink ˹of pure wine˺ from a flowing stream, that will cause them neither headache nor intoxication.  ˹They will also be served˺ any fruit they choose and meat from any bird they desire. And ˹they will have˺ maidens with gorgeous eyes, like pristine pearls,  ˹all˺ as a reward for what they used to do. There they will never hear any idle or sinful talk— only good and virtuous speech.1  </li>
        <li>Quran 56-28, ..., 34: ˹They will be˺ amid thornless lote trees, clusters of bananas, extended shade, flowing water, abundant fruit— never out of season nor forbidden— and elevated furnishings. </li>
        <li>Quran 56-41, ..., 46: And the people of the left—how ˹miserable˺ will they be! ˹They will be˺ in scorching heat and boiling water, in the shade of black smoke, neither cool nor refreshing. Indeed, before this ˹torment˺ they were spoiled by luxury, and persisted in the worst of sin.1   </li>
        <li>Quran 56-92, ..., 94: But if such person is one of the misguided deniers, then their accommodation will be boiling water ˹to drink˺ and burning in Hellfire. </li>
        <li>Quran 61-12: He will forgive your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and ˹house you in˺ splendid homes in the Gardens of Eternity. That is the ultimate triumph. almost bursting in fury. Every time a group is cast into it, its keepers will ask them, “Did a warner not come to you?” They will reply, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, ‘Allah has revealed nothing. You are extremely astray.’” </li>
        <li>Quran 67-7, 8: When they are tossed into it, they will hear its roaring as it boils over, </li>
        <li>Quran 69-30, ..., 37: ˹It will be said,˺ “Seize and shackle them, then burn them in Hell, then tie them up with chains seventy arms long. For they never had faith in Allah, the Greatest, nor encouraged the feeding of the poor. So this Day they will have no close friend here, nor any food except ˹oozing˺ pus, which none will eat except the evildoers.” </li>
        <li>Quran 73-12, 13: ˹For˺ We certainly have shackles, a ˹raging˺ Fire, choking food, and a painful punishment ˹in store for them˺ </li>
        <li>Quran 76-4, 5, 6: Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains, shackles, and a blazing Fire. Indeed, the virtuous will have a drink ˹of pure wine˺—flavoured with camphor—  ˹from˺ a spring where Allah’s servants will drink, flowing at their will. </li>
        <li>Quran 77-29, ..., 33: ˹The disbelievers will be told,˺ “Proceed into that ˹Fire˺ which you used to deny! Proceed into the shade ˹of smoke˺ which rises in three columns, providing neither coolness nor shelter from the flames. Indeed, it hurls sparks ˹as big˺ as huge castles, and ˹as dark˺ as black camels.”1</li>
        <li>Quran 77-41, 42, 43: Indeed, the righteous will be amid ˹cool˺ shade and springs and any fruit they desire. ˹They will be told,˺ “Eat and drink happily for what you used to do.” </li>
        <li>Quran 78-31, ..., 35: Indeed, the righteous will have salvation— Gardens, vineyards, and full-bosomed maidens of equal age, and full cups ˹of pure wine˺, never to hear any idle talk or lying therein—</li>
        <li>Quran 83-7, 8, 9: But no! The wicked are certainly bound for Sijjîn1 ˹in the depths of Hell˺— and what will make you realize what Sijjîn is?— a fate ˹already˺ sealed.1</li>
        <li>Quran 83-18: But no! The virtuous are certainly bound for ’Illiyûn1 ˹in elevated Gardens˺— </li>
        <li>Quran 83-22, ..., 28: Surely the virtuous will be in bliss,  ˹seated˺ on ˹canopied˺ couches, gazing around.  You will recognize on their faces the glow of delight.  They will be given a drink of sealed, pure wine,  whose last sip will smell like musk. So let whoever aspires to this strive ˹diligently˺. And this drink’s flavour will come from Tasnîm— a spring from which those nearest ˹to Allah˺ will drink. </li>

        <li>Quran 43-85: And Blessed is the One to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between! With Him ˹alone˺ is the knowledge of the Hour. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned. </li>
        <li>Quran 45-27: To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. On the Day the Hour will be established, the people of falsehood will then be in ˹total˺ loss. </li>
        <li>Quran 47-18: Are they only waiting for the Hour to take them by surprise? Yet ˹some of˺ its signs have already come.1 Once it actually befalls them, will it not be too late to be mindful? </li>
        <li>Quran 52-9, 10: on the Day the heavens will be shaken violently, and the mountains will be blown away entirely. </li>
        <li>Quran 52-45, 46: So leave them until they face their Day in which they will be struck dead—  the Day their scheming will be of no benefit to them whatsoever, nor will they be helped. </li>
        <li>Quran 54-1, ..., 4: The Hour has drawn near and the moon was split ˹in two˺.1 Yet, whenever they see a sign, they turn away,1 saying, “Same old magic!” They rejected ˹the truth˺ and followed their own desires—and every matter will be settled— even though the stories ˹of destroyed nations˺ that have already come to them are a sufficient deterrent. </li>
        <li>Quran 54-6, ..., 8: So turn away from them ˹O Prophet˺. ˹And wait for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the caller1 will summon ˹them˺ for something horrifying.2 With eyes downcast, they will come forth from the graves as if they were swarming locusts, rushing towards the caller. The disbelievers will cry, “This is a difficult Day!” </li>
        <li>Quran 55-37: ˹How horrible will it be˺ when the heavens will split apart, becoming rose-red like ˹burnt˺ oil! </li>
        <li>Quran 56-4, ..., : When the earth will be violently shaken, and the mountains will be crushed to pieces, becoming scattered ˹particles of˺ dust,  you will ˹all˺ be ˹divided into˺ three groups: the people of the right, how ˹blessed˺ will they be; the people of the left, how ˹miserable˺ will they be; and the foremost ˹in faith˺ will be the foremost ˹in Paradise˺. </li>Qu
        <li>Quran 57-13: On that Day hypocrite men and women will beg the believers, “Wait for us so that we may have some of your light.” It will be said ˹mockingly˺, “Go back ˹to the world˺ and seek a light ˹there˺!” Then a ˹separating˺ wall with a gate will be erected between them. On the near side will be grace and on the far side will be torment.1</li>
        <li>Quran 64-9: ˹Consider˺ the Day He will gather you ˹all˺ for the Day of Gathering—that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain. So whoever believes in Allah and does good, He will absolve them of their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. That is the ultimate triumph. </li>
        <li>Quran 68-42, 43: ˹Beware of˺ the Day the Shin ˹of Allah˺ will be bared,1 and the wicked will be asked to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so, with eyes downcast, totally covered with disgrace. For they were ˹always˺ called to prostrate ˹in the world˺ when they were fully capable ˹but they chose not to˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 69-13: At last, when the Trumpet will be blown with one blast, and the earth and mountains will be lifted up and crushed with one blow, on that Day the Inevitable Event will have come to pass. </li>
        <li>Quran 70-8, 9, 10: On that Day the sky will be like molten brass and the mountains like ˹tufts of˺ wool. And no close friend will ask ˹about˺ their friends, </li>
        <li>Quran 73-14: on the Day the earth and mountains will shake ˹violently˺, and mountains will be ˹reduced to˺ dunes of shifting sand. </li>
        <li>Quran 73-17, 18: If you ˹pagans˺ persist in disbelief, then how will you guard yourselves against ˹the horrors of˺ a Day which will turn children’s hair grey? It will ˹even˺ cause the sky to split apart. His promise ˹of judgment˺ must be fulfilled. </li>
        <li>Quran 77-8, ..., 14: So when the stars are put out, and the sky is torn apart, and the mountains are blown away, and the messengers’ time ˹to testify˺ comes up— for which Day has all this been set?  For the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision! And what will make you realize what the Day of Decision is? </li>
        <li>Quran 77-38: ˹They will be told by Allah,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision: We have gathered you along with earlier disbelievers ˹for punishment˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 78-17, ..., 28:  Indeed, the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is an appointed time— ˹it is˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and you will ˹all˺ come forth in crowds.  The sky will be ˹split˺ open, becoming ˹many˺ gates,  and the mountains will be blown away, becoming ˹like˺ a mirage. Indeed, Hell is lying in ambush as a home for the transgressors, where they will remain for ˹endless˺ ages. There they will not taste any coolness or drink, except boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus— a fitting reward. For they never expected any reckoning, </li>  
        <li>Quran 79-6, ..., 19: ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ the quaking Blast will come to pass,1 followed by a second Blast. ˹The deniers’˺ hearts on that Day will be trembling ˹in horror˺, with their eyes downcast. ˹But now˺ they ask ˹mockingly˺, “Will we really be restored to our former state, even after we have been reduced to decayed bones?”  Adding, “Then such a return would be a ˹total˺ loss ˹for us˺!” But indeed, it will take only one ˹mighty˺ Blast, and at once they will be above ground. Has the story of Moses reached you ˹O Prophet˺? His Lord called him in the sacred valley of Ṭuwa, ˹commanding,˺ “Go to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺. And say, ‘Would you ˹be willing to˺ purify yourself, and let me guide you to your Lord so that you will be in awe ˹of Him˺?’” </li>
        <li>Quran 79-34, ..., 39: But, when the Supreme Disaster1 comes to pass— the Day every person will remember all ˹their˺ striving, and the Hellfire will be displayed for all to see— then as for those who transgressed and preferred the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world, the Hellfire will certainly be ˹their˺ home. </li>    
        <li>Quran 80-33, ..., 42: Then, when the Deafening Blast1 comes to pass—  on that Day every person will flee from their own siblings,  and ˹even˺ their mother and father,  and ˹even˺ their spouse and children.  For then everyone will have enough concern of their own.  On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be bright, laughing and rejoicing, while ˹other˺ faces will be dusty, cast in gloom—  those are the disbelievers, the ˹wicked˺ sinners. </li>Q
        <li>Quran 81-1, ..., 14: When the sun is put out, and when the stars fall down, and when the mountains are blown away,  and when pregnant camels are left untended,1 and when wild beasts are gathered together,1 and when the seas are set on fire,1 and when the souls ˹and their bodies˺ are paired ˹once more˺, and when baby girls, buried alive, are asked for what crime they were put to death,1  and when the records ˹of deeds˺ are laid open, and when the sky is stripped away, and when the Hellfire is fiercely flared up, and when Paradise is brought near— ˹on that Day˺ each soul will know what ˹deeds˺ it has brought along. </li>
        <li>Quran 82-1, ..., 5: When the sky splits open, and when the stars fall away, and when the seas burst forth, and when the graves spill out, ˹then˺ each soul will know what it has sent forth or left behind. </li>
        <li>Quran 83-34, 35, 36:  But on that Day the believers will be laughing at the disbelievers,  as they sit on ˹canopied˺ couches, looking on.  ˹The believers will be asked,˺ “Have the disbelievers ˹not˺ been paid back for what they used to do?” </li>
        <li>Quran 84-1, ..., 5: When the sky bursts open, obeying its Lord as it must, and when the earth is flattened out,  and ejects ˹all˺ its contents1 and becomes empty, obeying its Lord as it must, ˹surely you will all be judged˺. </li> 
        <li>Quran 86-8, 9, 10: Surely He is fully capable of bringing them back ˹to life˺  on the Day all secrets will be disclosed.  Then one will have neither power nor ˹any˺ helper. </li>
        <li>Quran 88-1, ..., 16: Has the news of the Overwhelming Event reached you ˹O Prophet˺?  On that Day ˹some˺ faces will be downcast,  ˹totally˺ overburdened, exhausted,  burning in a scorching Fire,  left to drink from a scalding spring.  They will have no food except a foul, thorny shrub,  neither nourishing nor satisfying hunger.  On that Day ˹other˺ faces will be glowing with bliss,  ˹fully˺ pleased with their striving,  in an elevated Garden,  where no idle talk will be heard.  In it will be a running spring,  along with thrones raised high,  and cups set at hand,  and ˹fine˺ cushions lined up,  and ˹splendid˺ carpets spread out. </li>            
        <li>Quran 97-1, ... 5: Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ sent this ˹Quran˺ down on the Night of Glory.1  And what will make you realize what the Night of Glory is?  The Night of Glory is better than a thousand months.  That night the angels and the ˹holy˺ spirit1 descend, by the permission of their Lord, for every ˹decreed˺ matter.  It is all peace until the break of dawn. </li>   
        <li>Quran 98-1, ..., 8: When the earth is shaken ˹in˺ its ultimate quaking,  and when the earth throws out ˹all˺ its contents,1  and humanity cries, “What is wrong with it?”—  on that Day the earth will recount everything,  having been inspired by your Lord ˹to do so˺.  On that Day people will proceed in separate groups1 to be shown ˹the consequences of˺ their deeds.  So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it.  And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it. </li>

    <h4>The prophets on death</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>The Story of a Rich Householder: To him the Buddha said, "My disciple, death does not occur only in one
          place. All beings that are born must die one day; indeed, life ends in death. You must ever be mindful of the
          fact that life ends in death. Do not imagine that only your beloved son is subject to death. Do not be so
          distressed or be so shaken. Sorrow and fear arise out of affection."</li>
        <li>The Story of Mahadhana, a Merchant: Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled and the Buddha replied, "Ananda,
          do you see that merchant? He is thinking that he would stay here and sell his goods the whole year. He is not
          aware that he would die here in seven days' time. What should be done should be done today. Who would know
          that one would die tomorrow? We have no date fixed with the King of Death. For one who is mindful by day or by
          night, who is not disturbed by moral defilements and is energetic, to live for just one night is a well-spent
          life."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 287: The man who dotes on his children and his herds of cattle, whose mind longs for and is
          attached to sensual pleasures, is carried away by Death even as a sleeping village is swept away by a great
          flood.</li>
        <li>The Story of Kisagotami: To her the Buddha said, "Kisagotami, you think you are the only one who has lost a
          son. Death comes to all beings; before their desires are satiated Death takes them away."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 288: Not sons, nor parents, nor close relatives can protect one assailed by Death; indeed,
          neither kith nor kin can give protection.
          Verse 289: Knowing this, the wise man restrained by morality should quickly clear (the obstacles to) the Path
          leading to Nibbana.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Genesis 49-33: And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Quran 2-19: Or ˹those caught in˺ a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press
          their fingers into their ears at the sound of every thunder-clap for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the
          disbelievers ˹by His might˺.
        </li>
        <li>Quran 2-132: This was the advice of Abraham—as well as Jacob—to his children, ˹saying˺, “Indeed, Allah has chosen for you this faith; so do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission.” </li>
        <li>Quran 2-154: Never say that those martyred in the cause of Allah are dead-in fact, they are alive! But you do not percieve it.</li>
        <li>Quran 3-102: O believers! Be mindful of Allah in the way He deserves,1 and do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission ˹to Him˺.2</li>
        <li>Quran 3-145: No soul can ever die without Allah’s Will at the destined time. Those who desire worldly gain, We will let them have it, and those who desire heavenly reward, We will grant it to them. And We will reward those who are grateful. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-169: Never think of those martyred in the cause of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive with their Lord, well provided for— </li>
        <li>Quran 4-78: Wherever you may be, death will overcome you—even if you were in fortified towers.” When something good befalls them, they say, “This is from Allah,” but when something evil befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Both have been destined by Allah.” So what is the matter with these people? They can hardly comprehend anything! </li>
        <li>Quran 5-106: O believers! When death approaches any of you, call upon two just Muslim men to witness as you make a bequest; otherwise, two non-Muslims if you are afflicted with death while on a journey.1 If you doubt ˹their testimony˺, keep them after prayer and let them testify under oath ˹saying˺, “By Allah! We would never sell our testimony for any price, even in favour of a close relative, nor withhold the testimony of Allah. Otherwise, we would surely be sinful.” </li>
        <li>Quran 39-42: ˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ calls back the souls ˹of people˺ upon their death as well as ˹the souls˺ of the living during their sleep. Then He keeps those for whom He has ordained death, and releases the others until ˹their˺ appointed time. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect. </li>
        <li>Quran 50-19, ..., 29: ˹Ultimately,˺ with the throes of death will come the truth.1 This is what you were trying to escape! And the Trumpet will be blown.1 This is the Day ˹you were˺ warned of. Each soul will come forth with an angel to drive it and another to testify. ˹It will be said to the denier,˺ “You were totally heedless of this. Now We have lifted this veil of yours, so Today your sight is sharp!” And one’s accompanying-angel will say, “Here is the record ready with me.” ˹It will be said to both angels,˺ “Throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever, withholder of good, transgressor, and doubter, who set up another god with Allah. So cast them into the severe punishment.” One’s ˹devilish˺ associate will say, “Our Lord! I did not make them transgress. Rather, they were far astray ˹on their own˺.”  Allah will respond, “Do not dispute in My presence, since I had already given you a warning. My Word cannot be changed,1 nor am I unjust to ˹My˺ creation.”</li>
        <li>Quran 56-60, 61: We have ordained death for ˹all of˺ you, and We cannot be prevented from transforming and recreating you in forms unknown to you. </li>
        <li>Quran 56-83, 84: Why then ˹are you helpless˺ when the soul ˹of a dying person˺ reaches ˹their˺ throat, while you are looking on? </li>
        <li>Quran 62-7: But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have done.1 And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers. </li>
        <li>Quran 62-8: Say, “The death you are running away from will inevitably come to you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, and He will inform you of what you used to do.” </li>
        <li>Quran 63-11: But Allah never delays a soul when its appointed time comes. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
        <li>Quran 69-7: which Allah unleashed on them non-stop for seven nights and eight days, so that you would have seen its people lying dead like trunks of uprooted palm trees. </li>
        <li>Quran 75-26, ..., 35: But no! ˹Beware of the day˺ when the soul reaches the collar bone ˹as it leaves˺,  and it will be said, “Is there any healer ˹who can save this life˺?” And the dying person realizes it is ˹their˺ time to depart, and ˹then˺ their feet are tied together ˹in a shroud˺. On that day they will be driven to your Lord ˹alone˺. This denier neither believed nor prayed,  but persisted in denial and turned away, then went to their own people, walking boastfully. Woe to you, and more woe! Again, woe to you, and even more woe! </li>

        <li>The Story of Devadatta: "Once, while King Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, the future Buddha was born
          as a deer, and Devadatta was then a deer-stalker. One day, the deer-stalker saw the footprints of a deer under
          a tree. So, he put up a bamboo platform in the tree and waited with the spear ready for the deer. The deer
          came but he came very cautiously. The deer-stalker saw him hesitating, and threw some fruits of the tree to
          coax him. But that put the deer on guard; he looked more carefully and saw the deer-stalker in the tree. He
          pretended not to see the deer stalker and turned away slowly. From some distance, he addressed the tree thus:

          'O tree! You always drop your fruits vertically, but today you have broken the law of nature and have dropped
          your fruits slantingly. Since you have violated the nature law of trees, I am now leaving you for another
          tree.'

          "Seeing the deer turning away, the dear-stalker dropped his spear to the ground and said, 'Yes, you can now
          move on; for today, I have been wrong in my calculations.' The deer who was the Buddha-to-be replied, 'O
          hunter! You have truly miscalculated today, but your evil kamma will not take any mistake; it will certainly
          follow you.' Thus, Devadatta had attempted to kill me not only now but also in the past, yet he had never
          succeeded." 'Then the Buddha continued, 'Bhikkhus! Just as a creeper strangles the tree to which it clings, so
          also, those without morality, being overwhelmed by lust, are finally thrown into niraya."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 320: As an elephant in battlefield withstands the arrow shot from a bow, so shall I endure
          abuse. Indeed, many people are without morality.
          Verse 321: Only the trained (horses and elephants) are led to gatherings of people; the King mounts only the
          trained (horses and elephants). Noblest among men are the tamed, who endure abuse.
          Verse 322: Mules, thoroughbred horses, horses from Sindh, and great elephants are noble only when they are
          trained; but one who has tamed himself (through Magga Insight) is far nobler.</li>
        <li>The Story of the Bhikkhu Who Had Been a Trainer of Elephants: The Buddha called the ex-elephant trainer
          bhikkhu to him and said, "O vain bhikkhu, who is yet far away from Magga and Phala ! You do not gain anything
          by taming elephants. There is no one who can get to a place where one has never been before (i.e.. Nibbana) by
          taming elephants; only one who has tamed himself can get there."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 324: The elephant called Dhanapala, in severe must and uncontrollable, being in captivity,
          eats not a morsel, yearning for his native forest (i. e., longing to look after his parents). </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 327: Take delight in mindfulness, guard your mind well. As an elephant stuck in mire pulls
          itself out, so also, pull yourself out of the mire of moral defilements. </li>
        <li>The Story of a Number of Bhikkhus: "Venerable Sir! You must have had a hard time spending the vassa all
          alone in this forest."
          To this, the Buddha replied,"Bhikkhus, do not say so; the elephant Palileyyaka had been looking after me all
          this time. He was, indeed, a very good friend, a true friend. If one has such a good friend one should stick
          to him; but if one cannot find a good friend it is better to stay alone."</li>
        <li>The Story of Two Brahmins: So they went to the bank of the Aciravati River and there they filled up a cart
          with sand. One after the other, the bullocks pulled the cart, but they only pulled in vain, because the cart,
          did not move and only the ropes broke off. The bhikkhus seeing this reported to the Buddha and the Buddha said
          to them, "Bhikkhus! It is easy to break off the straps which you can see with your eyes; anyone can break them
          or cut them. But my sons, a bhikkhu should cut the strap of ill will and the thong of craving which are within
          you and which bind you."</li>
        <li>The Story of Angulimala: However, they could get only four hundred and ninety-nine trained elephants and so
          they had to put in an untrained elephant and it was allotted to hold the umbrella over Thera Angulimala. Every
          one was afraid that the untrained elephant might give trouble, but when brought near Thera Angulimala it was
          quite docile.</li>

        <li>Quran 3-49: and ˹make him˺ a messenger to the Children of Israel ˹to proclaim,˺ ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will make for you a bird from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a ˹real˺ bird—by Allah’s Will. I will heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead to life—by Allah’s Will. And I will prophesize what you eat and store in your houses. Surely in this is a sign for you if you ˹truly˺ believe. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-31: Then Allah sent a crow digging ˹a grave˺ in the ground ˹for a dead crow˺, in order to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I ˹even˺ failed to be like this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.1  </li>
        <li>Quran 6-38: All living beings roaming the earth and winged birds soaring in the sky are communities like yourselves.1 We have left nothing out of the Record.2 Then to their Lord they will be gathered all together. </li>
        <li>Quran 6-138: They say, “These cattle and crops are reserved—none may eat them except those we permit,” so they claim. Some other cattle are exempted from labour and others are not slaughtered in Allah’s Name—falsely attributing lies to Him. He will repay them for their lies. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-73: And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord: this is Allah’s she-camel as a sign to you. So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s land and do not harm her, or else you will be overcome by a painful punishment. 
        <li>Quran 7-179: Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-6: There is no moving creature on earth whose provision is not guaranteed by Allah. And He knows where it lives and where it is laid to rest. All is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.1 </li>
        <li>Quran 11-64: And O  my people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you.1 So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s earth and do her no harm, or a swift punishment will overtake you!” </li>
        <li>Quran 17-70: Indeed, We have dignified the children of Adam, carried them on land and sea, granted them good and lawful provisions, and privileged them far above many of Our creatures. </li>
        <li>Quran 24-41: Do you not see that Allah is glorified by all those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds as they soar? Each ˹instinctively˺ knows their manner of prayer and glorification. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all they do. </li>
        <li>Quran 24-45: And Allah has created from water every living creature. Some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
        <li>Quran 27-16, ..., 18: And David was succeeded by Solomon, who said, “O people! We have been taught the language of birds, and been given everything ˹we need˺. This is indeed a great privilege.” Solomon’s forces of jinn, humans, and birds were rallied for him, perfectly organized. And when they came across a valley of ants, an ant warned, “O ants! Go quickly into your homes so Solomon and his armies do not crush you, unknowingly.”</li>
        <li>Quran 27-22, ..., 26:  It was not long before the bird came and said, “I have found out something you do not know. I have just come to you from Sheba with sure news.  Indeed, I found a woman ruling over them,1 who has been given everything ˹she needs˺, and who has a magnificent throne. I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah. For Satan has made their deeds appealing to them—hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way and leaving them unguided— so they do not prostrate to Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you ˹all˺ conceal and what you reveal.  ˹He is˺ Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”  </li>
        <li>Quran 27-82: And when the decree ˹of the Hour˺ comes to pass against them, We will bring forth for them a beast from the earth,1 telling them that the people had no sure faith in Our revelations. </li>
        <li>Quran 29-60: How many are the creatures that cannot secure their provisions! ˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ provides for them and you ˹as well˺. He is indeed the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
        <li>Quran 38-18, 19: We truly subjected the mountains to hymn ˹Our praises˺ along with him in the evening and after sunrise. And ˹We subjected˺ the birds, flocking together. All turned to him ˹echoing his hymns˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 91-11: Thamûd rejected ˹the truth˺ out of arrogance, when the most wicked of them was roused ˹to kill the she-camel˺. But the messenger of Allah warned them, “˹Do not disturb˺ Allah’s camel and her ˹turn to˺ drink!”  Still they defied him and slaughtered her. So their Lord crushed them for their crime, levelling all to the ground.1 </li>

And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering. And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty; When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.</li>

For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.</li>
        <li>Leviticus 7-3, 4, 5: And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.</li>

And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.</li>
        <li>Leviticus 9-1, ..., 5: And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you. And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</li>
        <li>Leviticus 12-6, 7, 8: And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female. And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.</li>
        <li>Leviticus 14-2, ..., 7: This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest: And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water: As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water: And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</li>
        <li>Leviticus 14-10, ..., 20: And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD: And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD. And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering: And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.</li>
        <li>Leviticus 14-49, ..., 53: And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times: And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet: But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.</li>

        <li>Quran 22-36: We have made sacrificial camels ˹and cattle˺ among the symbols of Allah, in which there is ˹much˺ good for you. So pronounce the Name of Allah over them when they are lined up ˹for sacrifice˺. Once they have fallen ˹lifeless˺ on their sides, you may eat from their meat, and feed the needy—those who do not beg, and those who do. In this way We have subjected these ˹animals˺ to you so that you may be grateful. </li>
        <li>Quran 22-37: Neither their meat nor blood reaches Allah. Rather, it is your piety that reaches Him. This is how He has subjected them to you so that you may proclaim the greatness of Allah for what He has guided you to, and give good news to the good-doers</li>
        <li>Quran 22-58: As for those who emigrate in the cause of Allah and then are martyred or die, Allah will indeed grant them a good provision. Surely Allah is the Best Provider. </li>

        <li>Dhammapada Verse 274: This is the only Path, and there is none other for the purity of vision. Follow this
          Path; it will bewilder Mara.</li>
        <li>The Story of Mara: To him the Buddha replied, "O wicked Mara! Your teaching and my teaching are quite
          different. You and I cannot have any discussion. This is my teaching".</li>
        <li>The Story of Mara: On one occasion, Mara came to the Buddha disguised as a man and asked him, "Venerable
          Sir, You often say the word 'param'. What is the meaning of that word?" The Buddha, knowing that it was Mara
          who was asking that question, chided him, "O wicked Mara! The words 'param' and 'aparam' have nothing to do
          with you. 'Param' which means 'the other shore' can be reached only by the arahats who are free from moral
          defilements."</li>

        <li>Quran 2 - 168, 169: O humanity! Eat from what is lawful and good on the earth and do not follow Satan's footsteps. He is truly your sworn enemy. He only incites you to commit evil and indecency, and to claim against Allah what you do not know</li>
        <li>Quran 2-268: The Devil threatens you with ˹the prospect of˺ poverty and bids you to the shameful deed ˹of stinginess˺, while Allah promises you forgiveness and ˹great˺ bounties from Him. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-120: Satan only makes them ˹false˺ promises and deludes them with ˹empty˺ hopes. Truly Satan promises them nothing but delusion. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-90: O believers! Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for decisions1 are all evil of Satan’s handiwork. So shun them so you may be successful. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-91: Satan’s plan is to stir up hostility and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah and praying. Will you not then abstain? </li>
        <li>Quran 6-112: And so We have made for every prophet enemies—devilish humans and jinn—whispering to one another with elegant words of deception. Had it been your Lord’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their deceit, </li>
        <li>Quran 7-200, 201: If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. Indeed, when Satan whispers to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, they remember ˹their Lord˺ then they start to see ˹things˺ clearly. </li>
        <li>Quran 8-49: And ˹remember˺ when Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, and said, “No one can overcome you today. I am surely by your side.” But when the two forces faced off, he cowered and said, “I have absolutely nothing to do with you. I certainly see what you do not see. I truly fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.” 
        <li>Quran 12-42: Then he said to the one he knew would survive, “Mention me in the presence of your master.1” But Satan made him forget to mention Joseph to his master, so he remained in prison for several years. </li>
        <li>Quran 14-22: And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise. I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce your previous association of me with Allah ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.” </li>
        <li>Quran 17-64: And incite whoever you can of them with your voice, mobilize against them all your cavalry and infantry, manipulate them in their wealth and children, and make them promises.” But Satan promises them nothing but delusion. </li>
        <li>Quran 18-50: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,1 who was one of the jinn, but he rebelled against the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants as patrons instead of Me, although they are your enemy? What an evil alternative for the wrongdoers ˹to choose˺! </li>
        <li>Quran 18-63: He replied, “Do you remember when we rested by the rock? ˹That is when˺ I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.”1</li>
        <li>Quran 19-44, 45: O  dear father! Do not worship Satan. Surely Satan is ever rebellious against the Most Compassionate. O  dear father! I truly fear that you will be touched by a torment from the Most Compassionate, and become Satan’s companion ˹in Hell˺.” </li>
        <li>Quran 20-116: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,1 who refused ˹arrogantly˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 22-52: Whenever We sent a messenger or a prophet before you ˹O Prophet˺ and he recited ˹Our revelations˺, Satan would influence ˹people’s understanding of˺ his recitation. But ˹eventually˺ Allah would eliminate Satan’s influence. Then Allah would ˹firmly˺ establish His revelations. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
        <li>Quran 24-21: O believers! Do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Whoever follows Satan’s footsteps, then ˹let them know that˺ he surely bids ˹all to˺ immorality and wickedness. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, none of you would have ever been purified. But Allah purifies whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
        <li>Quran 35-5: O humanity! Indeed, Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver1 deceive you about Allah. </li>
        <li>Quran 41-36: And if you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Indeed, He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
        <li>Quran 43-62: And do not let Satan hinder you, ˹for˺ he is certainly your sworn enemy. </li>
        <li>Quran 47-25: Indeed, those who relapse ˹into disbelief˺ after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them, ˹it is˺ Satan ˹that˺ has tempted them, luring them with false hopes. </li>
        <li>Quran 58-10: Secret talks are only inspired by Satan to grieve the believers. Yet he cannot harm them whatsoever except by Allah’s Will. So in Allah let the believers put their trust. </li>
        <li>Quran 58-19: Satan has taken hold of them, causing them to forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of Satan. Surely Satan’s party is bound to lose. </li>
        <li>Quran 59-16: ˹They are˺ like Satan when he lures someone to disbelieve. Then after they have done so, he will say ˹on Judgment Day˺, “I have absolutely nothing to do with you. I truly fear Allah—the Lord of all worlds.”1  and who have devised a tremendous plot, </li>
        <li>Quran 71-21, 22: ˹Eventually,˺ Noah cried, “My Lord! They have certainly persisted in disobeying me, and followed ˹instead˺ those ˹elite˺ whose ˹abundant˺ wealth and children only increase them in loss, </li>
