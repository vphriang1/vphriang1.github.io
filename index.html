      <h4>The prophets on faithfulness</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>The Story of Uttara the Lay-Disciple: The Buddha then said, "Well done, well done, Uttara! By not bearing
            any ill will you have been able to conquer one who has done you wrong through hate. By not abusing, you
            should conquer one who abuses you; by being generous you should conquer one who is stingy; by speaking the
            truth you should conquer one who tells lies."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Dhammarama: The Buddha was satisfied and was very pleased with the explanation and
            conduct of Dhammarama and he said, "My son, Dhammarama, you have done very well. A bhikkhu who loves and
            respects me should act like you. Those who made offerings of flowers, scents and incense to me are not
            really paying me homage. Only those who practise the Dhamma are the ones who truly pay homage to me."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 415: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has given up sensual pleasures, and
            leaving the home-life has become a bhikkhu; who has eradicated sensual desires and has come to the end of
            existence.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such
            a relaxation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of
            K'wang do to me? (C.A. quote 301)</li>
          <li>My friends, why are you distressed by our master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the
            principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with it's wooden tongue (C.A.
            quote 99)</li>
          <li>Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, "To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is
            perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, an under heaven will
            ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?"
            (C.A. quote 455)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said to him, "There is the following saying which I have heard-'Death and life have their
            determined appointment; riches and honors depend upon Heaven.' (C.A. quote 465)</li>
          <li>The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot
            be taken from him (C.A. quote 327)</li>
          <li>He revived states that had been extinguished, restored whose line of succession had been broken, and
            called to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that throughout the kingdom the hearts of the
            people turned towards him. (C.A. quote 843)</li>

            Quran 2-40:  O children of Israel!1 Remember My favours upon you. Fulfil your covenant and I will fulfil Mine, and stand in awe of Me ˹alone˺. 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-135: The Jews and Christians each say, “Follow our faith to be ˹rightly˺ guided.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “No! We follow the faith of Abraham, the upright—who was not a polytheist.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-155: We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure-</li>
          <li>Quran 2-156: who, when faced with disaster, say, "Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we will all return</li>
          <li>Quran 2-218: Surely those who have believed, emigrated, and struggled in the Way of Allah—they can hope for Allah’s mercy. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-249: When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he and the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is ˹always˺ with the steadfast.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-285: The Messenger ˹firmly˺ believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They ˹all˺ believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers. ˹They proclaim,˺ “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. ˹We seek˺ Your forgiveness, our Lord! And to You ˹alone˺ is the final return.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-76: Absolutely! Those who honour their trusts and shun evil—surely Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-144: Muḥammad is no more than a messenger; other messengers have gone before him. If he were to die or to be killed, would you regress into disbelief? Those who do so will not harm Allah whatsoever. And Allah will reward those who are grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-146: ˹Imagine˺ how many devotees fought along with their prophets and never faltered despite whatever ˹losses˺ they suffered in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken or give in! Allah loves those who persevere. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-172: ˹As for˺ those who responded to the call of Allah and His Messenger after their injury,1 those of them who did good and were mindful ˹of Allah˺ will have a great reward. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-173: Those who were warned, “Your enemies have mobilized their forces against you, so fear them,” the warning only made them grow stronger in faith and they replied, “Allah ˹alone˺ is sufficient ˹as an aid˺ for us and ˹He˺ is the best Protector.” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-35: If you anticipate a split between them, appoint a mediator from his family and another from hers. If they desire reconciliation, Allah will restore harmony between them. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-66: If We had commanded them to sacrifice themselves or abandon their homes, none would have obeyed except for a few. Had they done what they were advised to do,1 it would have certainly been far better for them and more reassuring, </li>
          <li>Quran 4-74: Let those who sacrice this life for the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. And whoever fights in Allah's cause-whether they achieve martydom or victory-We will honour them with a great reward.</li>
          <li>Quran 5-84: Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? And we long for our Lord to include us in the company of the righteous.” </li>
          <li>Quran 5-101: O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you, may disturb you. But if you inquire about what is being revealed in the Quran, it will be made clear to you. Allah has forgiven what was done ˹in the past˺.1 And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-151: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Come! Let me recite to you what your Lord has forbidden to you: do not associate others with Him ˹in worship˺. ˹Do not fail to˺ honour your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for you and for them. Do not come near indecencies, openly or secretly. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right.1 This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will understand. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-161: And ˹remember˺ when it was said to them, “Enter this city ˹of Jerusalem˺ and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, ˹and˺ We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-163: Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath.1 During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-170: As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-18: As such, Allah frustrates the evil plans of the disbelievers.</li>
          <li>Quran 8-24: O believers! Respond to Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah stands between a person and their heart, and that to Him you will all be gathered. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-16: Do you ˹believers˺ think that you will be left without Allah proving who among you ˹truly˺ struggles ˹in His cause˺ and never takes trusted allies other than Allah, His Messenger, or the believers? And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-23: O believers! Do not take your parents and siblings as trusted allies if they choose disbelief over belief. And whoever of you does so, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-51: Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except what Allah has destined for us. He is our Protector.” So in Allah let the believers put their trust. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-86: Whenever a sûrah is revealed stating, “Believe in Allah and struggle along with His Messenger,” the rich among them would ask to be exempt, saying, “Leave us with those who remain behind.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-92: Nor ˹is there any blame on˺ those who came to you ˹O Prophet˺ for mounts, then when you said, “I can find no mounts for you,” they left with eyes overflowing with tears out of grief that they had nothing to contribute. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-120: It was not ˹proper˺ for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs around them to avoid marching with the Messenger of Allah or to prefer their own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of Allah; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-109: And follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah passes His judgment. For He is the Best of Judges. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-75: Truly, Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, and ever turning ˹to his Lord˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-24: She advanced towards him, and he would have done likewise, had he not seen a sign from his Lord.1 This is how We kept evil and indecency away from him, for he was truly one of Our chosen servants. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-34: So his Lord responded to him, turning their cunning away from him. Surely He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-38: I follow the faith of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not ˹right˺ for us to associate anything with Allah ˹in worship˺. This is part of Allah’s grace upon us and humanity, but most people are not grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-64:  He responded, “Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother ˹Joseph˺? But ˹only˺ Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.” 
          <li>Quran 14-37: Our Lord! I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley, near Your Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may establish prayer. So make the hearts of ˹believing˺ people incline towards them and provide them with fruits, so perhaps they will be thankful. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-4: saying, “My Lord! Surely my bones have become brittle, and grey hair has spread across my head, but I have never been disappointed in my prayer to You, my Lord! </li>
          <li>Quran 21-49:  who are in awe of their Lord without seeing Him,1 and are fearful of the Hour. </li>

      <h4>The prophets on sincerity</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li> Dhammapada Verse 10: He who has discarded all moral defilements (kilesas), who is established in moral
            precepts, is endowed with restraint and (speaks the) truth is, indeed, worthy of the yellow robe.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 12: They take truth for truth; they take untruth for untruth; such persons arrive at the
            truth, for they hold right views. At the end of the discourse, many people came to be established in
            Sotapatti Fruition.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada verse 20: Though he recites only a little of the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but practises
            according to the Dhamma,
            eradicating passion, ill will and ignorance, clearly comprehending the Dhamma, with his mind freed from
            moral
            defilements and no longer clinging to this world or to the next, he shares the benefits of the life of a
            bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 50: One should not consider the faults of others, nor their doing or not doing good or
            bad deeds. One should consider only whether one has done or not done good or bad deeds.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 52: Just as a flower, beautiful as well as fragrant, will give the wearer the benefit of
            its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha will benefit one who practises the Dhamma.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 84: For his own sake or for the sake of others, he does no evil; nor does he wish for
            sons
            and daughters or for wealth or for a kingdom by doing evil; nor does he wish for success by unfair means;
            such a one is indeed virtuous, wise and just. </li>
          <li>The Story of Lajadevadhita: So he told her not to come to the monastery any more, as people might start
            talking if she kept on coming to the monastery. Lajadevadhita was very upset; she pleaded with the thera and
            cried, "Please do not destroy my riches, my wealth." The Buddha heard her cries and sent forth the radiance
            from his chamber and said to the female deva, "Devadhita, it is the duty of my son Kassapa to stop your
            coming to the monastery; to do good deeds is the duty of one who is anxious to gain merit."</li>
          </ul>

        <ul>

          <li>A man should say, I am not concerned I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am
            not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known (C.A. 119)</li>
          <li>When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we
            should turn inwards and examine ourselves (C.A. quote 123)</li>
          <li>I will not be concerned at men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of ability (C.A. quote
            607)</li>
          <li>In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do
            sometimes exceed in praise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual. (C.A. quote
            666)</li>
          <li>He who does not anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his not being believed, and
            yet apprehends these things readily when they occur;-is he not a man of superior worth?" (C.A. quote 608)
          </li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked what were the characteristics of the good man. The Master said, "He does not tread in the
            footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the chamber of the sage." (C.A. quote 429)</li>
          <li>The chief of the Mang family having appointed Yang Fu to the chief criminal judge, the latter consulted
            the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, "The rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently have
            been disorganized for a long time. When you have found out the truth of any accusation, be grieved for and
            pity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability." (C.A. 823)</li>
          <li>The duke then said, "Is there a single sentence which can ruin a country?" Confucius replied, "Such an
            effect as that cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the saying which people have-'I have
            no pleasure in being a prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what I say (C.A. quote
            536)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu never slept over a promise (C.A. quote 482)</li>
          <li>But what is the necessity for a complete man of the present day to have all these things? The man, who in
            the view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of danger is prepared to give up his life; and
            who does not forget an old agreement however far back it extends:-such a man may be reckoned a COMPLETE man

          <li>Quran 2-184: Fast a prescribed number of days. But whoever of you is ill or on a journey, then let them fast an equal number of days after Ramadan. For those who can only fast with extreme difficulty, compensation can be made by feeding a needy person for every day not fasted. But whoever volunteers to give more, it is better for them. And to fast is better for you, if only you knew.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-209:  If you falter after receiving the clear proofs, then know that Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-229: Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain ˹his wife˺ with honour or separate ˹from her˺ with grace.1 It is not lawful for husbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless the couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of Allah.2 So if you fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce.3 These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-239: If you are in danger, pray on foot or while riding. But when you are safe, ˹take time to˺ remember Allah for teaching you what you did not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-9: Let the guardians be as concerned ˹for the orphans˺ as they would if they were to ˹die and˺ leave ˹their own˺ helpless children behind. So let them be mindful of Allah and speak equitably. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-68: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not grieve for the people who disbelieve.</li>
          <li>Quran 5-83: When they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears for recognizing the truth. They say, “Our Lord! We believe, so count us among the witnesses. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-152: And do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Give full measure and weigh with justice. We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. Whenever you speak,1 maintain justice—even regarding a close relative. And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-188: Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-118: And ˹Allah has also turned in mercy to˺ the three who had remained behind, ˹whose guilt distressed them˺ until the earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They knew there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-15: When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say ˹to the Prophet˺, “Bring us a different Quran or make some changes in it.” Say ˹to them˺, “It is not for me to change it on my own. I only follow what is revealed to me. I fear, if I were to disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.” </li>
          <li>Quran 10-28: ˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then say to those who associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺, “Stay in your places—you and your associate-gods.” We will separate them from each other, and their associate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped! </li>
          <li>Quran 10-58: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ they amass.” </li>
          <li>Quran 10-99: Had your Lord so willed ˹O Prophet˺, all ˹people˺ on earth would have certainly believed, every single one of them! Would you then force people to become believers? </li>
          <li>Quran 11-36: And it was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will believe except those who already have. So do not be distressed by what they have been doing. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-86: What is left ˹as a lawful gain˺ by Allah is far better for you if you are ˹truly˺ believers. And I am not a keeper over you.”</li>
          <li>Quran 13-18: Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves. They will face strict judgment, and Hell will be their home. What an evil place to rest! </li>
          <li>Quran 14-11: Their messengers said to them, “We are ˹indeed˺ only humans like you, but Allah favours whoever He chooses of His servants. It is not for us to bring you any proof without Allah’s permission. And in Allah let the believers put their trust. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-114: Exalted is Allah, the True King! Do not rush to recite ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran ˹O Prophet˺ before it is ˹properly˺ conveyed to you,1 and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.” </li>

      <h4>The prophets on truthfulness</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>The Story of Sirima: The Buddha then asked the king to get a town crier announce that Sirima would be
            available on payment of one thousand in cash per night. But no body would take her for one thousand, or for
            five hundred, or for two hundred and fifty, or even if she were to be given free of charge. Then the Buddha
            said to the audience, "Bhikkhus! Look at Sirima. When she was living, there were many who were willing to
            give one thousand to spend one night with her; but now none would take her even if given without any
            payment. The body of a person is subject to deterioration and decay."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 147: Look at this dressed up body, a mass of sores, supported (by bones), sickly, a
            subject of many thoughts (of sensual desire). Indeed, that body is neither permanent nor enduring. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 148: This body is worn out-with age, it is the seat of sickness, it is subject to decay.
            This putrid body disintegrates; life, indeed, ends in death. </li>
          <li>The Story of Queen Mallika: To him the Buddha said, "Look at these carriages of your father and your
            grandfather; these are all worn down and lying useless; so also is your body, which is subject to death and
            decay. Only the Dhamma of the Virtuous is not subject to decay."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 151: The much ornamented royal carriages do wear out, the body also grows old, but the
            Dhamma of the Virtuous does not decay. Thus, indeed, say the Virtuous among themselves. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 160: One indeed is one's own refuge; how can others be a refuge to one? With oneself
            thoroughly tamed, one can attain a refuge (i.e., Arahatta Phala), which is so difficult to attain. </li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: As soon as they entered the compound of the monastery, a storm broke
            out; as big drops of rain fell, bubbles were formed on the ground and soon disappeared. Seeing those
            bubbles, the bhikkhus reflected "This body of ours is perishable like the bubbles", and perceived the
            impermanent nature of the aggregates (khandhas).</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sammajjana: Other bhikkhus noticed some rubbish piling up in the compound and they
            asked Sammajjana why he was not sweeping as much as he used to, and he replied, "When I was not mindful, I
            was all the time sweeping; but now I am no longer unmindful." When the bhikkhus heard his reply they were
            sceptical; so they went to the Buddha and said, "Venerable Sir! Thera Sammajjana falsely claims himself to
            be an arahat; he is telling lies." To them the Buddha said, "Sammajjana has indeed attained arahatship; he
            is telling the truth."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Young Bride: By his supernormal power, the Buddha willed that the bride would not be
            visible to the bridegroom. When the young man could no longer see the young woman, he could pay full
            attention to the Buddha, and his love and respect for the Buddha grew stronger in him. Then the Buddha said
            to the young man, "O young man, there is no fire like the fire of passion; there is no evil like anger and
            hatred; there is no ill like the burden of the five aggregates of existence (khandhas); there is no bliss
            like the Perfect Peace of Nibbana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 276: You yourselves should make the effort; the Tathagatas (Buddhas) only can show the
            way. Those who practise the Tranquillity and Insight Meditation are freed from the bond of Mara.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: So they went to the Buddha and said, "Thera Tissa claims himself to be an arahat
            ; he is not speaking the truth." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, my son Tissa was speaking the truth
            when he said he did not get angry. He has indeed become an arahat he is no longer attached to anyone; he has
            no occasion to get angry with anyone nor any need to associate with others."</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Dhammadinna: His wife Dhammadinna retorted, "Who would swallow the spittle you have
            thrown up?" Then she asked permission from him to enter the Order and became a bhikkhuni. After becoming a
            bhikkhuni she went to a monastery in a small village in the company of other bhikkhunis to practise
            meditation.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-27: those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺ Allah
            has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land. It is they who are the ˹true˺ losers. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "He, who from day to day recognizes what he has not yet, and from month to month does not
            forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love to learn." (C.A. quote 808)</li>
          <li>Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not
            lead to the instruction of its object? (C.A. quote 568)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "I would prefer not speaking." (C.A. quote 761) Tsze-kung said, "If you, Master, do not
            speak, what shall we, your disciples, have to record?" (C.A. quote 762) The Master said, "Does Heaven
            speak?
            The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say
            anything?" (C.A. quote 763)</li>

        <ul><li>n/a</li></ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Quran 2-42: Do not mix truth with falsehood or hide the truth knowingly.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-146: Those We have given the Scripture recognize this ˹Prophet˺ as they recognize their own children. Yet a group of them hides the truth knowingly. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-230: So if a husband divorces his wife ˹three times˺, then it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and then is divorced. Then it is permissible for them to reunite, as long as they feel they are able to maintain the limits of Allah. These are the limits set by Allah, which He makes clear for people of knowledge. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-286: Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹The believers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-20: If you desire to replace a wife with another and you have given the former ˹even˺ a stack of gold ˹as a dowry˺, do not take any of it back. Would you ˹still˺ take it unjustly and very sinfully? </li>
          <li>Quran 4-72, 73: There will be some among you who will lag behind so that if you face a disaster, they will say, "Allah has blessed us for not being there among them." But if you resturn with Allah's bounties, they will say-as if there had been no bond between you-"We wish we had been there with them to share the great gain!"</li>
          <li>Quran 4-138: Give good news of a painful punishment to hypocrites, </li>
          <li>Quran 5-89: Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-66: Now Allah has lightened your burden, for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there be one thousand, they will overcome two thousand, by Allah’s Will. And Allah is with the steadfast.</li>
          <li>Quran 9-111: Allah has indeed purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah and kill or are killed. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. And whose promise is truer than Allah’s? So rejoice in the exchange you have made with Him. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-113: It is not ˹proper˺ for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were close relatives, after it has become clear to the believers that they are bound for the Hellfire. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-29: Allah is sufficient as a Witness between each of us that we were totally unaware of your worship.”</li>
          <li>Quran 11-13: Or do they say, “He1 has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-88: He said, “O my people! Consider if I stand on a clear proof from my Lord and He has blessed me with a good provision from Him. I do not want to do what I am forbidding you from. I only intend reform to the best of my ability. My success comes only through Allah. In Him I trust and to Him I turn. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-29: O  Joseph! Forget about this. And you ˹O wife˺! Seek forgiveness for your sin.1 It certainly has been your fault.” 
          <li>Quran 12-39: O  my fellow-prisoners! Which is far better: many different lords or Allah—the One, the Supreme? </li>
          <li>Quran 12-51: The King asked ˹the women˺, “What did you get when you tried to seduce Joseph?” They replied, “Allah forbid! We know nothing indecent about him.” Then the Chief Minister’s wife admitted, “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely truthful. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-53: And I do not seek to free myself from blame, for indeed the soul is ever inclined to evil, except those shown mercy by my Lord. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-89: ˹Consider, O  Prophet,˺ the Day We will call against every faith-community a witness of their own. And We will call you to be a witness against these ˹people of yours˺. We have revealed to you the Book as an explanation of all things, a guide, a mercy, and good news for those who ˹fully˺ submit. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-56: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Invoke those you claim ˹to be divine˺1 besides Him—they do not have the power to undo harm from you or transfer it ˹to someone else˺.”</li>
          <li>Quran 19-65: ˹He is the˺ Lord of the heavens, and the earth, and everything in between. So worship Him ˹alone˺, and be steadfast in His worship. Do you know of anyone equal to Him ˹in His attributes˺?” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-48: It has indeed been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies ˹the truth˺ and turns away.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-6: That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth, He ˹alone˺ gives life to the dead, and He ˹alone˺ is Most Capable of everything. </li>

          <li>Quran 2-60: And ˹remember˺ when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out, ˹and˺ each tribe knew its drinking place. ˹We then said,˺ “Eat and drink of Allah’s provisions, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-103: And hold firmly to the rope of Allah1 and do not be divided. Remember Allah’s favour upon you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so you—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at the brink of a fiery pit and He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may be ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-165: Why is it when you suffered casualties ˹at Uḥud˺—although you had made your enemy suffer twice as much ˹at Badr˺—you protested, “How could this be?”? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is because of your disobedience.” Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-191: ˹They are˺ those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth ˹and pray˺, “Our Lord! You have not created ˹all of˺ this without purpose. Glory be to You! Protect us from the torment of the Fire. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-45: We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers. </li>

          <li>Quran 7-57, 58: He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy. When they bear heavy clouds, We drive them to a lifeless land and then cause rain to fall, producing every type of fruit. Similarly, We will bring the dead to life, so perhaps you will be mindful. The fertile land produces abundantly by the Will of its Lord, whereas the infertile land hardly produces anything. This is how We vary ˹Our˺ lessons to those who are thankful. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-59: If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger had given them and said, “Allah is sufficient for us! Allah will grant us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. To Allah ˹alone˺ we turn with hope.”</li>
          <li>Quran 14-34: And He has granted you all that you asked Him for. If you tried to count Allah’s blessings, you would never be able to number them. Indeed humankind is truly unfair, ˹totally˺ ungrateful.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 15-20: And We made in it means of sustenance for you and others, who you do not provide for. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-78: And Allah brought you out of the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing, and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect so perhaps you would be thankful.

            Verse 366: Though he receives only a little, if a bhikkhu does not despise what he has received (by proper

          <li>Quran 4-79: Whatever good befalls you is from Allah and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself.1 We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ as a messenger to ˹all˺ people. And Allah is sufficient as a Witness. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-35: If you find their denial unbearable, then build—if you can—a tunnel through the earth or stairs to the sky to bring them a ˹more compelling˺ sign. Had Allah so willed, He could have guided them all. So do not be one of those ignorant ˹of this fact˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-42: Indeed, We have sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ to other people who We put through suffering and adversity ˹for their denial˺, so perhaps they would be humbled. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-43: Why did they not humble themselves when We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-11, 12: Surely We created you,1 then shaped you, then said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,2 who refused to prostrate with the others. Allah asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.” </li>

Moses said to him, “May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?”1 He said, “You certainly cannot be patient ˹enough˺ with me. And how can you be patient with what is beyond your ˹realm of˺ knowledge?” Moses assured ˹him˺, “You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.” He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I ˹myself˺ clarify it for you.” So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!” He replied, “Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?” Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.” So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.” He answered, “Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?” Moses replied, “If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.” So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they found a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, “If you wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.” He replied, “This is the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear patiently. “As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I intended to damage it, for there was a ˹tyrant˺ king ahead of them who seizes every ˹good˺ ship by force. “And as for the boy, his parents were ˹true˺ believers, and we1 feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief.  So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place. “And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come of age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it ˹all˺ on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently.”1  </li>
          <li>Quran 21-87, 88: And ˹remember˺ when the Man of the Whale stormed off ˹from his city˺ in a rage, thinking We would not restrain him.1 Then in the ˹veils of˺ darkness2 he cried out, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except You. Glory be to You! I have certainly done wrong.”  So We answered his prayer and rescued him from anguish. And so do We save the ˹true˺ believers. </li>

            the Buddha. In their presence, Mara taunted the Buddha, "O Buddha, since you received no alms-food this
            morning, you must be feeling the pangs of hunger!" To him the Buddha replied, "O wicked Mara, even though we
            do not get any food, like the Abhassara brahmas who live only on the delightful satisfaction (piti) and
            bliss (sukha) of jhana, we shall live on the delightful satisfaction and bliss of the Dhamma."</li>

            have any feeling of fear while climbing down from such a great height (i.e., about ninety feet), he answered
            in the negative. The bhikkhus took that to mean that Uggasena was claiming to have attained arahatship even
            then. So, they went to the Buddha and said, "Venerable Sir! Uggasena claims himself to be an arahat; he must
            be telling lies." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, one who has cut off all fetters, like my son

            management of business, to reverently attentive; in intercourse with others to be strictly sincere. Though
            a
            man go among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be neglected." (C.A. quote 543)</li>
          <li>The firm, the enduring, the simple, and the modest are near to virtue (C.A. quote 556)</li>
          <li>A horse is called a ch'i, not because of its other good qualities. (C.A. quote 611)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "There are learning extensively, and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with
            earnestness, and reflecting with self-application:-virtue is in such a course." (C.A. quote 809)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "When a person does not transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass
            and
            repass it in the small virtues." (C.A. quote 814)</li>
          <li>Yu[-I] those who know virtue are few (C.A. quote 638)</li>
          <li>The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it
            may be known that he is virtuous (C.A. quote 112)</li>
          <li>Virtue is more to man than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on water or fire, but
            I
            have never seen a man die from treading the course of virtue (C.A. quote 679)</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 257: The wise man who decides not arbitrarily but in accordance with the law is one who
            safeguards the law; he is to be called 'one who abides by the law (dhammattho)'.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 259: He is not "one versed in the Dhamma (Dhammadhara)" just because he talks much. He
            who hears only a little but comprehends the Dhamma, and is not unmindful is, indeed, "one versed in the
            Dhamma". </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 260: He is not a thera just because his head is grey; he who is ripe only in years is
            called "one grown old in vain".
            Verse 261: Only a wise man who comprehends the Four Noble Truths and the Dhamma, who is harmless and
            virtuous, who restrains his senses and has rid himself of moral defilements is indeed called a thera.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 262: Not by fine talk, nor by good looks could one be a good-hearted man, if he were
            envious, miserly and crafty.
            Verse 263: A wise man who has cut off, uprooted and removed these and has rid himself of moral defilements
            is indeed called a good-hearted man.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 370: Cut off the five (the lower five fetters) give up the five (the upper five fetters);
            and develop the five (controlling faculties). The bhikkhu who has freed himself of the five bonds (passion,
            ill will, ignorance, pride and wrong view) is called "One who has crossed the flood (of samsara)."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: To those bhikkhus, the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, a true brahmana does not
            beat another true brahmana; only an ordinary man or an ordinary brahmin would beat an arahat in anger and
            ill will. This ill will should be eradicated by Anagami Magga."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 391: Him I call a brahmana who does no evil in deed or word or thought, who is restrained
            in these three respects.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 401: Him I call a brahmana, who does not cling to sensual pleasures, just as water does
            not cling to a lotus leaf, or the mustard seed to the tip of an awl.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: But the thera reflected that it was not, in fact, practising medicine and he
            realized that even the cave spirit could find no other fault with him. That gave him a delightful
            satisfaction (piti) with himself, and abandoning piti and concentrating hard on Insight Meditation he
            attained arahatship then and there, while still standing at the entrance to the cave.</li>

            worldly gain and diligently practises the dhamma in solitude, he is sure to attain arahatship."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 182: Hard to gain is birth as man; hard is the life of mortals; hard to get is the

          <li>The Story of the Thera Who Stayed Alone: But the Buddha did not blame him; instead he said, "Yes, indeed,

          <li>Quran 6-153: Indeed, that is My Path—perfectly straight. So follow it and do not follow other ways, for they will lead you away from His Way. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be conscious ˹of Allah˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-62: But if their intention is only to deceive you, then Allah is certainly sufficient for you. He is the One Who has supported you with His help and with the believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-28: O believers! Indeed, the polytheists are ˹spiritually˺ impure,1 so they should not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year.2 If you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you out of His bounty, if He wills. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>

          <li>Quran 16-93: Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community ˹of believers˺, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills.1 And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-1: All praise is for Allah Who has revealed the Book to His servant,1 allowing no crookedness in it,

          <li>Quran 19-49, 50: So after he had left them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and made each of them a prophet. We showered them with Our mercy, and blessed them with honourable mention.1  </li>

          <li>The Story of Santati the Minister: "In the past there has been in you clinging (upadana) due to craving;
            get rid of it. In future, do not let such clinging occur in you. Do not also harbour any clinging in the
            present; by not having any clinging, craving and passion will be calmed in you and you will realize
            Nibbana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 285: Cut off your craving as one plucks an autumn lily with the hand. Nibbana has been
            expounded on by the Buddha; cultivate that Path which leads to it. </li>
          <li>On Subduing Oneself: Hearing those abusive words, the Venerable Ananda pleaded with the Buddha to leave
            the town and go to another place. But the Buddha refused and said, "In another town also we might be abused
            and it is not feasible to move out every time one is abused. It is better to solve a problem in the place
            where it arises. I am like an elephant in a battlefield; like an elephant who withstands the arrows that
            come from all quarters, I also will bear patiently the abuses that come from people without morality.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 349: In a man who is disturbed by (sensual) thoughts, whose passions are strong, and who
            keeps seeing objects as being pleasant, craving grows more and more. Indeed, he makes his bondage strong.
            Verse 350: A man who takes delight in calming (sensual) thoughts, who is ever mindful, and meditates on the

          <li>Dhammapada Verses 104 & 105: It is better indeed, to conquer oneself than to conquer others. Neither a

            controls himself. </li>
          <li>The Story of Anathapindika: When the guardian spirit told Anathapindika about the information and
            instructions given by Sakka, about the recovery of his riches from underneath the earth, from within the
            ocean and from the debtors, he was struck with awe. Then Anathapindika took the guardian spirit to the
            Buddha. To both of them the Buddha said, "One may not enjoy the benefits of a good deed, or suffer the
            consequences of a bad deed for a long time; but time will surely come when his good or bad deed will bear
            fruit and ripen".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 308: It is better for one to eat a red-hot lump of iron burning like a flame than to eat
            alms-food offered by the people, if one is without morality (sila) and unrestrained in thought, word and
            deed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 368: The bhikkhu who lives exercising loving-kindness and is devoted to the Teaching of

          <li>When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a

            Confucius said, "Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are different from this. The
            father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father. Uprightness

          <li>The Story of Thera Pilindavaccha: Then, on reflection the Buddha found that for the past five hundred
            existences, the thera had been born only in the families of the brahmins, who regarded themselves as being
            superior to other people. So the Buddha said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus! Thera Vaccha addresses others as
            'wretch' only by force of habit acquired in the course of his five hundred existences as a brahmin, and not
            out of malice. He has no intention of hurting others, for an arahat does not harm others."</li>

            keep sabbath and to learn some religious texts. To him the Buddha replied, "Anathapindika! Today, your son

          <li>Dhammapada Verses 186 & 187: Not by a shower of coins can sensual desires be satiated; sensual desires
            give little pleasure and are fraught with evil consequences (dukkha). Knowing this, the wise man, who is the
            disciple of the Buddha, does not find delight even in the pleasures of the devas, but rejoices in the
            cessation of craving (i.e., Nibbana). </li>
          <li>The Story of Many Bhikkhus: Once, five hundred bhikkhus were discussing the question "What constitutes
            happiness?" These bhikkhus realized that happiness meant different things to different people. Thus, they
            said, "To some people to have the riches and glory like that of a king's is happiness, to some people
            sensual pleasure is happiness, but to others to have good rice cooked with meat is happiness." While they
            were talking, the Buddha came in. After learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, all
            the pleasures you have mentioned do not get you out of the round of rebirths. In this world, these
            constitute happiness: the arising of a Buddha, the opportunity to hear the Teaching of the Sublime Truth,
            and the harmony amongst the bhikkhus,</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 194: Happy is the arising of a Buddha; happy is the exposition of the Ariya Dhamma; happy
            is the harmony amongst the Samgha; happy is the practice of those in harmony.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 202: There is no fire like passion; there is no evil like hatred; there is no ill like
            (the burden of) khandhas; there is no bliss that surpasses the Perfect Peace (i.e., Nibbana). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 203: Hunger is the greatest ailment, khandhas are the greatest ill. The wise, knowing
            them as they really are, realize Nibbana, the greatest bliss. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 204: Health is the greatest gift, contentment is the greatest wealth, a trusted friend is
            the best relative, Nibbana is the greatest bliss. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 213: Endearment begets sorrow, endearment begets fear. For him who is free from
            endearment there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 214: Attachment (to sensual pleasures) begets sorrow, attachment begets fear. For him who
            is free from attachment there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 215: Lust begets sorrow, lust begets fear. For him who is free from lust there is no
            sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 216: Craving begets sorrow, craving begets fear. For him who is free from craving there
            is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 218: He who has developed a desire for the Ineffable (i.e., Nibbana), whose mind reaches
            the same, and is no longer attached to the sensual world (kamaloka), is called one who is bound upstream
            (uddhamsoto). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 221: Give up anger, abandon conceit, overcome all fetters. Ills of life (dukkha) do not
            befall [on] one who does not cling to mind and body and is free from moral defilements. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 223: Conquer the angry one by not getting angry (i.e., by loving-kindness); conquer the
            wicked by goodness; conquer the stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 224: One should speak the truth, one should not yield to anger, one should give when
            asked even if it is only a little. By means of these three, one may go to the world of the devas. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 225: The arahats, who do not harm others and are always restrained in their actions, go
            to the deathless Nibbana, where there is no sorrow. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 226: In those who are ever vigilant, who by day and by night train themselves in the
            three sikkhas (i.e., sila, samadhi and panna), and who have their mind directed towards Nibbana, moral
            intoxicants become extinct. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 251: There is no fire like passion, there is no grip like ill will, there is no net like
            ignorance, there is no river like craving. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Ujjhanasanni: The Buddha replied to them, "Bhikkhus, if someone finds fault with
            another so as to teach him in good way; it is not an act of evil and is therefore not to be blamed. But, if
            someone is always finding fault with others and speaking ill of them just out of spite and malice, he will
            not attain concentration and mental absorption (jhana). He will not be able to understand the Dhamma, and
            moral (intoxicants asavas) will increase in him."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 254: In the sky there is no track; outside the Buddha's Teaching there is no ariya
            bhikkhu (samana). All beings take delight in fetters (i.e., craving, pride and wrong view) that prolong
            samsara; all the Buddhas are free from these fetters.
            Verse 255: In the sky there is no track; outside the Buddha's Teaching there is no ariya bhikkhu (samana).
            There is no conditioned thing that is permanent; all the Buddhas are unperturbed (by craving, pride and
            wrong view).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 258: He is not a wise man just because he talks much; only he who is peaceful, free from
            enmity, and does no harm to others, is to be called 'a wise man'.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 270: He who harms living beings is, for that reason, not an ariya (a Noble One); he who
            does not harm any living being is called an ariya1.
            1. ariya: one who has realized one of the four maggas.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 273: Of paths, the Path of Eight Constituents is the noblest; of truths, the Four Noble
            Truths are the noblest; of the dhammas, the absence of craving (i.e., Nibbana) is the noblest; of the
            two-legged beings, the All-Seeing Buddha is the noblest.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 277: "All conditioned phenomena are impermanent"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom,
            one becomes weary of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.
            Verse 278: "All conditioned phenomena are dukkha"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom, one becomes weary
            of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.
            Verse 279: "All phenomena (dhammas) are without Self"; when one sees this with Insight-wisdom, one becomes
            weary of dukkha (i.e., the khandhas). This is the Path to Purity.</li>
          <li>The Story of Patacara*: When she approached the Buddha, he said to her, "Patacara, sons and daughters
            cannot look after you; so even if they are alive they do not exist for you. The wise man observes morality
            (sila) and clears (the obstacles to) the Path leading to Nibbana."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Wood-Cutter's Son: The king asked the Buddha, "Is mindfulness of the unique qualities of
            the Buddha, the only dhamma that gives one protection against evil and danger, or is mindfulness of the
            unique qualities of the Dhamma equally potent and powerful?" To him the Buddha replied, "O king, my
            disciple! There are six things, mindfulness of which is a good protection against evil and danger."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 302: It is hard to become a bhikkhu; it is hard to be happy in the practice of a bhikkhu.
            The hard life of a householder is painful; to live with those of a different temperament is painful. A
            traveller in samsara is continually subject to dukkha; therefore, do not be a traveller in samsara; do not
            be the one to be subject to dukkha again and again. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 348: Give up the past, give up the future, give up the present. Having reached the end of
            existences, with a mind freed from all (conditioned things), you will not again undergo birth and decay.
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 373: The bhikkhu who goes into seclusion (to meditate), whose mind is tranquil, who
            clearly perceives the Dhamma, experiences the joy which transcends that of (ordinary) men.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 381: The bhikkhu who frequently feels joy and is devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha
            will realize Nibbana — the Tranquil, the Unconditioned, the Blissful.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 403: Him I call a brahmana, who is wise and is profound in his knowledge, who knows the
            right way from the wrong way, and who has attained the highest goal (i.e., arahatship).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 419: Him I call a brahmana, who knows the death and rebirth of beings in every detail,
            who is detached, who follows the good practice and knows the Four Noble Truths.
            Verse 420: Him I call a brahmana, whose destination the devas or gandhabbas or men do not know who has
            eradicated moral intoxicants and is an arahat.</li>

          <li>The Story of Adhimanika Bhikkhus: There, when they saw the putrid corpses they could look at them as just
            skeletons, and bones, but when they saw some fresh dead bodies they realized, with horror, that they still
            had some sensual desires awakening in them. The Buddha saw them from his perfumed chamber and sent forth the
            radiance; then he appeared to them and said, "Bhikkhus! Seeing these bleached bones, is it proper for you to
            have any sensual desire in you?"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 157: If one knows that one is dear to oneself, one should protect oneself well. During
            any of the three watches (of life) the wise man should be on guard (against evil).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 166: For the sake of another's benefit, however great it may be, do not neglect one's own
            (moral) benefit. Clearly perceiving one's own benefit one should make every effort to attain it. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 170: If a man looks at the world (i.e., the five khandhas) in the same way as one looks
            at a bubble or a mirage, the King of Death will not find him. </li>
          <li>The Story of Visakha: So she went to the Buddha; when the Buddha saw her, he said, "Visakha, don't you
            realize that many people die in Savatthi every day? If you were to regard all of them as you regard your own
            grandchild you would have to be endlessly weeping and mourning. Let not the death of a child affect you too
            much. Sorrow and fear arise out of endearment."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 231: Guard against evil deeds, control your body. Giving up evil deeds, cultivate good

            Indeed, they are perfectly self-controlled.</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Bhikkhus: Finally, they went to the Buddha to ask for his decision. The Buddha said to
            them, "Each of the senses is just as difficult to control as the other; but all bhikkhus must control all
            the five senses and not just one. Only those who control all the senses would escape from the round of

          <li>The Story of a Brahmin Recluse: So he went to the Buddha and posed the question why he should not be
            called a pabbajita. The Buddha's answer to him was this: "Just because one is a recluse one does not
            automatically become a pabbajita; a pabbajita must have other qualifications also."</li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 53: As from a collection of flowers many a garland can be made by an expert florist, so
            also, much good can be done (with wealth, out of faith and generosity) by one subject to birth and death.
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 97: He who is not credulous, who has realized the Unconditioned (Nibbana), who has cut
            off the links of the round of rebirths, who has destroyed all consequences of good and bad deeds, who has
            discarded all craving, is indeed the noblest of all men (i.e., an arahat). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 102: Better than the recitation of a hundred verses that are senseless and unconnected
            with the realization of Nibbana, is the recitation of a single verse of the Teaching (Dhamma), if on hearing
            it one is calmed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 123: Just as a wealthy merchant with few attendants avoids a dangerous road, just as one
            who desires to go on living avoids poison, so also, one should avoid evil. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: Having heard his explanation, the Buddha said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus! Those
            who love and respect me should act like Tissa. You are not paying homage to me by just offering me flowers,
            perfumes and incense. You pay homage to me only by practising the Lokuttara Dhamma, i.e., Insight
            Meditation."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 326: In the past, this mind has wandered as it liked, wherever it liked, at its own
            pleasure. Now I will control my mind wisely, as a mahout with his goad controls an elephant in must. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Abusive Brahmin Brothers: The Buddha in his turn asked, "O brahmin, let us suppose you
            offered some food to some guests and they left the house without taking the food. Since the guests did not
            accept your food, to whom would that food belong?" To this question the brahmin answered that the food would
            be his. On receiving that answer, the Buddha said, "In the same way, O brahmin, since I do not accept your
            abuse, the abuse would only go back to you."</li>

            wine:-which one of the things do I attain to?" (C.A. quote 318) The Master standing by a stream said, "It
            passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!" (C.A. quote 319)</li>

          <li>Quran 4-36: Worship Allah ˹alone˺ and associate none with Him.

Surely Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful— </li>
          <li>Quran 4-109: Here you are! You ˹believers˺ are advocating for them in this life, but who will ˹dare to˺ advocate for them before Allah on the Day of Judgment? Or who will come to their defence? </li>
          <li>Quran 6-11: Say, “Travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers.” </li>

          <li>Quran 10-94: If you ˹O Prophet˺ are in doubt about ˹these stories˺ that We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt, </li>
          <li>Quran 10-98: If only there had been a society which believed ˹before seeing the torment˺ and, therefore, benefited from its belief, like the people of Jonah.1 When they believed, We lifted from them the torment of disgrace in this world and allowed them enjoyment for a while.2  </li>
          <li>Quran 11-26: Joseph responded, “It was she who tried to seduce me.” And a witness from her own family testified: “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth and he is a liar.  But if it is torn from the back, then she has lied and he is truthful.” </li>

            Dhammapada Verse 8: He who keeps his mind on the impurities (of the body), who is well-controlled in his
            senses and is full of faith and energy, will certainly be not overwhelmed by Mara, just as stormy winds
            cannot shake a mountain of rock.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 60: Long is the night to one who is wakeful; long is (the journey of) one yojana to the
            traveller who is tired; long is samsara (round of rebirths) to the fool, who is ignorant of the true
            Dhamma (the Teaching of the Buddha).</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera* Sukha: "When a person earnestly practises the Dhamma, even Sakka and the devas give
            protection and help. I myself have kept Sariputta at the entrance so that Sukha should not be disturbed. The
            samanera, having seen the farmers irrigating their fields, the fletchers straightening their arrows and the
            carpenters making cart-wheels and other things, trains his mind and practises the Dhamma. Thus, he has now
            become an arahat."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 235: You are now like a withered leaf; the messengers of death are near you; you are
            about to set out on a long journey; (yet), you have no provisions (for the journey).
            Verse 236: Make a firm support for yourself; hasten to strive hard, and be wise. Having removed impurities
            and being free from moral defilements you shall enter the abodes of the Ariyas (i.e., Suddhavasa brahma
            realm).
            Verse 237: Now you are of advanced age; you are going to the presence of the King of Death and you cannot
            stop on the way; (yet) you have no provisions (for the journey).
            Verse 238: Make a firm support for yourself; hasten to strive hard, and be wise. Having removed impurities
            and being free from moral defilements you will no longer be subject to rebirth and decay.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Nangalakula: Whenever this feeling arose in him, he would go to the tree near the
            monastery, the tree where he had left his plough and his old clothes. There he would reproach himself
            saying, "O you shameless man! Do you still want to put on these old rags and return to the hard, lowly life
            of a hired labourer ?" After this, his dissatisfaction with the life of a bhikkhu would disappear and he
            would go back to the monastery</li>

          <li>Quran 3-120:  When you ˹believers˺ are touched with good, they grieve; but when you are afflicted with evil, they rejoice. ˹Yet,˺ if you are patient and mindful ˹of Allah˺, their schemes will not harm you in the least. Surely Allah is Fully Aware of what they do. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-160: If Allah helps you, none can defeat you. But if He denies you help, then who else can help you? So in Allah let the believers put their trust.</li>
          <li>Quran 5-56: Whoever allies themselves with Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers, then it is certainly Allah’s party that will prevail. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-92: This is a blessed Book which We have revealed—confirming what came before it—so you may warn the Mother of Cities1 and everyone around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter ˹truly˺ believe in it and guard their prayers. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-156: Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You ˹in repentance˺.” Allah replied, “I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-26: Remember when you had been vastly outnumbered and oppressed in the land,1 constantly in fear of attacks by your enemy, then He sheltered you, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so perhaps you would be thankful.
          <li>Quran 8-65: O Prophet! Motivate the believers to fight. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are one hundred of you, they will overcome one thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a people who do not comprehend. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-71: The believers, both men and women, are guardians of one another. They encourage good and forbid evil, establish prayer and pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is they who will be shown Allah’s mercy. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>

          <li>Quran 12-18: And they brought his shirt, stained with false blood.1 He responded, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something ˹evil˺. So ˹I can only endure with˺ beautiful patience!2 It is Allah’s help that I seek to bear your claims.” </li>
          <li>Quran 12-33:  Joseph prayed, “My Lord! I would rather be in jail than do what they invite me to. And if You do not turn their cunning away from me, I might yield to them and fall into ignorance.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-28: those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort. </li>

          <li>Quran 15-97, 98, 99: We certainly know that your heart is truly distressed by what they say.  So glorify the praises of your Lord and be one of those who ˹always˺ pray, and worship your Lord until the inevitable1 comes your way. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-98, 99, 100: When you recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed. He certainly has no authority over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord. His authority is only over those who take him as a patron and who—under his influence—associate ˹others˺ with Allah ˹in worship˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-128: Surely Allah is with those who shun evil and who do good ˹deeds˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-123, 124: Allah said, “Descend, both of you, from here together ˹with Satan˺ as enemies to each other. Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray ˹in this life˺ nor suffer ˹in the next˺. But whoever turns away from My Reminder will certainly have a miserable life,1 then We will raise them up blind on the Day of Judgment.” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-83, 84: And ˹remember˺ when Job cried out to his Lord, “I have been touched with adversity,1 and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” So We answered his prayer and removed his adversity, and gave him back his family, twice as many, as a mercy from Us and a lesson for the ˹devoted˺ worshippers. </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 2: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief;
            they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow
            that
            never leaves him.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 24: If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in his thought, word and deed, and if he
            does
            every thing with care and consideration, restrains his senses, earns his living according to the Law
            (Dhamma) and is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune of that mindful person steadily increase.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 76: One should follow a man of wisdom who rebukes one for one's faults, as one would
            follow a guide to some buried treasure. To one who follows such a wise man, it will be an advantage and
            not a disadvantage. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Brahmin Anatthapucchaka: Further, the Buddha asked the brahmin how he earned his living,
            and the brahmin replied that he earned his living by playing dice, i.e., by gambling. Next, the Buddha asked
            him whether he won or lost. When the brahmin answered that he sometimes lost and sometimes won, the Buddha
            said to him, "To win in a game of dice is nothing compared to a victory over moral defilements."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 109: For one who always respects and honours those who are older and more virtuous, four
            benefits, viz., longevity, beauty, happiness and strength, will increase. </li>
          <li>The Story of Ayuvaddhanakumara: When the child grew up, he went about the country with a company of five
            hundred fellow devotees. One day, they came to the Jetavana monastery, and the bhikkhus, recognizing him,
            asked the Buddha, "For beings, is there any means of gaining longevity?" To this question the Buddha
            answered, "By respecting and honouring the elders and those who are wise and virtuous, one would gain not
            only longevity, but also beauty, happiness and strength."</li>
          <li>The Story of Culekasataka: When the bhikkhus heard about this, they asked the Buddha, "How is it that, in
            the case of this brahmin, a good deed done at present bears fruit immediately?" To them the Buddha replied
            "If the brahmin had offered his outer garment in the first watch of the night, he would have been rewarded
            with sixteen of each kind; if he had made his offering during the middle watch, he would have been rewarded
            with eight of each kind; since he had made his offering only during the last watch of the night, he was
            rewarded with only four of each kind." So, when one wants to give in charity, one should do so quickly; if
            one procrastinates, the reward comes slowly and only sparingly. Also, if one is too slow in doing good
            deeds, one may not be able to do it at all, for the mind tends to take delight in doing evil.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 193: It is hard to find the noblest of men; he is not born everywhere nor in every clan.
            To whatever clan such a wise man is born, that clan prospers. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 282: Indeed, wisdom is born of meditation; without meditation wisdom is lost. Knowing
            this twofold path of gain and loss of wisdom, one should conduct oneself so that wisdom may increase. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 290: If by giving up small pleasures great happiness is to be found, the wise should give
            up small pleasures seeing (the prospect of) great happiness. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 323: Indeed, not by any means of transport (such as elephants and horses) can one go to
            the place one has never been before (i.e., Nibbana); but by thoroughly taming oneself, the tamed one can get
            to that place (i.e., Nibbana).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 356: Weeds damage fields; lust spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from
            lust yields great benefit.
            Verse 357: Weeds damage fields; ill will spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from ill will
            yields great benefit.
            Verse 358: Weeds damage fields; ignorance spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from ignorance
            yields great benefit.
            Verse 359: Weeds damage fields; covetousness spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from
            covetousness yields great benefit.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 364: The bhikkhu who abides in the Dhamma, who delights in the Dhamma, who meditates on
            the Dhamma, and is ever mindful of the Dhamma, does not fall away from the Dhamma of the virtuous.</li>

          <li>Quran 4-46: Some Jews take words out of context and say, “We listen and we disobey,” “Hear! May you never hear,” and “Râ’ina!” [Herd us!]—playing with words and discrediting the faith. Had they said ˹courteously˺, “We hear and obey,” “Listen to us,” and “Unẓurna,” [Tend to us!] it would have been better for them and more proper.

          <li>Quran 4-95: Those who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.

Allah has promised each a fine reward, but those who strive will receive a far better reward than others— </li>
          <li>Quran 4-100: Whoever emigrates in the cause of Allah will find many safe havens and bountiful resources throughout the earth.

          <li>Quran 4-173: As for those who believe and do good, He will reward them in full and increase them out of His grace. But those who are too proud and arrogant, He will subject them to a painful punishment. And besides Allah they will find no protector or helper. </li>

          <li>Quran 7-34: For each community there is an appointed term. When their time arrives, they can neither delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-157: “˹They are˺ the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel.1 He commands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them what is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from their burdens and the shackles that bound them. ˹Only˺ those who believe in him, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be successful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-38: Tell the disbelievers that if they desist, their past will be forgiven. But if they persist, then they have an example in those destroyed before them. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-121: And whenever they make a donation, small or large, or cross a valley ˹in Allah’s cause˺—it is written to their credit, so that Allah may grant them the best reward for what they used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-26: Those who do good will have the finest reward1 and ˹even˺ more.2 Neither gloom nor disgrace will cover their faces. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-108: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! The truth has surely come to you from your Lord. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-11:  except those who patiently endure and do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and a mighty reward. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-52: And O my people! Seek your Lord’s forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. He will shower you with rain in abundance, and add strength to your strength. So do not turn away, persisting in wickedness.” </li>
          <li>Quran 12-54: The King said, “Bring him to me. I will employ him exclusively in my service.” And when Joseph spoke to him, the King said, “Today you are highly esteemed and fully trusted by us.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-22:  And ˹they are˺ those who endure patiently, seeking their Lord’s pleasure,1 establish prayer, donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—and respond to evil with good. It is they who will have the ultimate abode: </li>
          <li>Quran 16-116: Do not falsely declare with your tongues, “This is lawful, and that is unlawful,” ˹only˺ fabricating lies against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will never succeed. </li>

          <li>Quran 19-76: And Allah increases in guidance those who are ˹rightly˺ guided. And the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in outcome.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 21-94:  So whoever does good and is a believer will never be denied ˹the reward for˺ their striving, for We are recording it all. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 46: One who knows that this body is impermanent like froth, and comprehends that it is
            insubstantial like a mirage will cut the flowers of Mara (i.e., the three kinds of vatta or rounds), and
            pass out of sight of the King of Death.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 90: For him (an arahat) whose journey is ended, who is free from sorrow and from all
            (e.g. khandha aggregates), who has destroyed all fetters, there is no more distress. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Asked by Jivaka: "Jivaka! Ever since I attained Buddhahood there has been no
            pain and distress for me."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 96: An arahat is calm in his mind, calm in his speech, and also in his deed; truly
            knowing the Dhamma, such an arahat is free from moral defilements and is unpurturbed by the ups and downs of
            life. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Three Daughters of Mara: Then, the Buddha continued, "Brahmin Magandiya, even when I saw
            those peerless daughters of Mara, I felt no sensual desire in me. After all, what is this body of your
            daughter? It is full of urine and filth; I don't like to touch it even with my foot!"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 201: Conquest begets enmity; the conquered live in misery; the peaceful live happily
            having renounced conquest and defeat. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 205: Having had the taste of solitude and the taste of Perfect Peace of Nibbana, one who
            drinks in the joy of the essence of the Dhamma is free from fear and evil. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 212: Affection begets sorrow, affection begets fear. For him who is free from affection
            there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him?</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 291: He who seeks his own happiness by inflicting pain on others, being entangled by
            bonds of enmity, cannot be free from enmity. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Bhikkhu from the Country of the Vajjis: As he looked towards the city, standing alone in
            the monastery, the bhikkhu felt lonely and dissatisfied with his lot. Softly, he murmured to himself, "There
            can be no one whose lot is worse than mine". At that instant, the spirit guarding the woods appeared to him,
            and said, "those beings in niraya envy the lot of the beings in the deva world; so also, people envy the lot
            of those who live alone in the woods." </li>
          <li>The Story on Imprisonment: To them the Buddha answered, "Bhikkhus! These bonds are nothing compared to
            those of craving for food and clothing, for riches and for family. Craving is a thousand times, a hundred
            thousand times stronger than those chains, hand-cuffs and cages. That is the reason why the wise cut off
            craving and renounce the world and enter the Order of the bhikkhus."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 384: When the brahmana is well-established in the two dhammas (i.e., the practice of
            Tranquillity and Insight Meditation), then, in that knowing one, all fetters are destroyed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 397: Him I call a brahmana, who has cut off all fetters and is fearless, who is beyond
            attachment and is free from moral defilements.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Certain Brahmin: To him the Buddha said, "This bhikkhu has laid down the burden (of the
            khandhas)." The brahmin took that to mean that his slave had become an arahat. So to make sure, he asked the
            Buddha whether it was true that the young bhikkhu had become an arahat, and the Buddha confirmed his
            statement</li>

            such talents and virtue, remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan and Wu. Where could
            our Master go that he should not have an opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was there

            Admirable indeed was the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single gourd dish of drink,
            and
            living in his mean narrow lane, while others could not have endured the distress, he did not allow his joy

            his lute, while it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and "My wishes," he said, "are different
            from the cherished purposes of these three gentlemen." "What harm is there in that?" said the Master; "do
            you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes." Tien then said, "In this, the last month of spring,
            with
            the dress of the season all complete, along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap, and six
            or

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 35: The mind is difficult to control; swiftly and lightly, it moves and lands wherever
            it
            pleases. It is good to tame the mind, for a well-tamed mind brings happiness.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 51: Just as a beautiful flower, lacking in scent, cannot give the wearer the benefit of
            its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha cannot benefit one who does not practise the
            Dhamma.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 100: Better than a thousand words that are senseless and unconnected with the realization
            of Nibbana, is a single word of sense, if on hearing it one is calmed. </li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Rupananda (Janapadakalyani): "A thorn can only be taken out with a thorn; Rupananda
            being very attached to her body and being very proud of her beauty, I must take the pride and attachment out
            of her through beauty."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 159: One should act as one teaches others; only with oneself thoroughly tamed should one
            tame others. To tame oneself is, indeed, difficult. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Attadattha: The Buddha then said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus, those who love and revere
            me should act like Attadattha. You are not paying me homage by just offering flowers, perfumes and incense
            and by coming to see me; you pay me homage only by practising the Dhamma I have taught you, i.e., the
            Lokuttara Dhamma."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Lay-Disciple: Afterwards, the Buddha and his disciples returned to the Jetavana monastery.
            On the way, the bhikkhus remarked that it was so surprising that the Buddha should have directed those
            people to feed the young man before he gave the discourse. On hearing their remarks, the Buddha said,
            "Bhikkhus! What you said is true, but you do not understand that I have come here, all this distance of
            thirty yojanas, because I knew that he was in a fitting condition to take in the Dhamma. If he were feeling
            very hungry, the pangs of hunger might have prevented him from taking in the Dhamma fully. That man had been
            out looking for his ox the whole morning, and was very tired and also very hungry. Bhikkhus, after all,
            there is no ailment which is so difficult to bear as hunger."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Son of a Butcher: So the Buddha said, "My disciple! You are getting old; but you have not
            made any provisions of merit for your journey to the next existence; you should now find a support for
            yourself."</li>
          <li>The Story of Ekudana the Arahat: To them the Buddha said. "Bhikkhus! I do not say that a bhikkhu who has
            learnt much and talks much of the Dhamma is one who is versed in the Dhamma, (Dhammadhara)." One who has
            learnt very little and knows only one stanza of the Dhamma, but fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths, and
            is ever mindful is the one who is truly versed in the Dhamma."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 268 & 269: Not by silence does one become a muni, if one is dull and ignorant. Like one
            holding a pair of scales, the wise one takes what is good and rejects what is evil. For this reason he is a
            muni. He who understands both internal and external aggregates is also, for that reason, called a muni</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 372: There can be no concentration in one who lacks wisdom; there can be no wisdom in one
            who lacks concentration. He who has concentration as well as wisdom is, indeed, close to Nibbana.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 377: O bhikkhus! As the jasmin (vassika) plant sheds its withered flowers, so also,
            should you shed passion and ill will.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Vakkali: As a bhikkhu, Vakkali always kept close to the Buddha; he did not care much
            about other duties of a bhikkhu and did not at all practise concentration meditation. So, the Buddha said to
            him, "Vakkali, it will be of no use to you by always keeping close to me, looking at my face. You should
            practise concentration meditation; for, indeed, only the one who sees the Dhamma sees me. One who does not
            see the Dhamma does not see me. So, you must leave my presence."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 408: Him I call a brahmana, who speaks gentle, instructive and true words, and who does
            not offend anyone by speech.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Other bhikkhus misunderstood Thera Sariputta's instructions, and said to the
            Buddha, "Venerable Sir! Thera Sariputta is still attached to material things like robes and other requisites
            of a bhikkhu." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! My son Sariputta has no more craving in him. He told
            you to bring the robes to him, so that the chances to perform meritorious deeds may not decrease for
            lay-disciples, and the chances to accept whatever they may properly receive may not be reduced for young

            formerly I have heard you say, 'When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a superior man will
            not associate with him.' Pi Hsi is in rebellion, holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him, what
            shall be said?" (C.A. quote 737) The Master said, "Yes, I did use these words. But is it not said, that,
            if
            a thing be really hard, it may be ground without being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be
            really
            white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made black? (C.A. quote 738)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, "Who are you sir?" He answered, "I am Chung Yu."
            "Are
            you not the disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?" asked the other. "I am," replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to
            him, "Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will change its
            state for you? Rather than follow one who merely withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better
            follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?" With this he fell to covering up the seed, and
            proceeded with his work, without stopping. (C.A. quote 785) Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when
            the Master observed with a sigh, "It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they were the
            same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-with whom shall I associated? If right
            principles prevailed through the empire, there would be no use for me to change its state." (C.A. quote
            786)
          </li>
          <li>Tsze-lu then said to the family, "Not to take office is not righteous. If the relations between old and
            young may not be neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be observed between
            sovereign and minister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to come to
            confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the
            failure
            of right principles to make progress, he is aware of that." (C.A. quote 791)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "Even in inferior studies and employments there is something worth being looked at; but
            if
            it be attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a danger of their proving inapplicable.
            Therefore, the superior man does not practice them." (C.A. quote 807)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "Without recognizing the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man.
            (C.A. quote 849)</li>
          <li>Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be
            established
            (C.A. quote 850)</li>
          <li>Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men (C.A. quote 851)</li>

            Quran 2-142: The foolish among the people will ask, “Why did they turn away from the direction of prayer they used to face?”1 Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The east and west belong ˹only˺ to Allah. He guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.” 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-182: Whoever suspects an error or an injustice in the will and brings about a fair setlement among the parties will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-194: There will be no retaliation in a sacred month for an offence in a sacred month, and all violations will bring about retaliation. So, if anyone attacks you, retaliate in the same manner. But be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is with those mindful of Him.</li>
          <li>Quran 4-43: O believers! Do not approach prayer while intoxicated1 until you are aware of what you say, nor in a state of ˹full˺ impurity2—unless you merely pass through ˹the mosque˺—until you have bathed. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth, wiping your faces and hands.3 And Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving.</li>
          <li>Quran 4-101: When you travel through the land, it is permissible for you to shorten the prayer1—˹especially˺ if you fear an attack by the disbelievers. Indeed, the disbelievers are your sworn enemies. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-140: He has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s revelations being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit in that company unless they engage in a different topic, or else you will be like them.1 Surely Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-141: He is the One Who produces gardens—both cultivated and wild1—and palm trees, crops of different flavours, olives, and pomegranates—similar ˹in shape˺, but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Eat of the fruit they bear and pay the dues at harvest, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-60: Alms-tax is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to administer it, for those whose hearts are attracted ˹to the faith˺, for ˹freeing˺ slaves, for those in debt, for Allah’s cause, and for ˹needy˺ travellers. ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-122: ˹However,˺ it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at once. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to gain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to them, so that they ˹too˺ may beware ˹of evil˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-35: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods guide to the truth?” Say, “˹Only˺ Allah guides to the truth.” Who then is more worthy to be followed: the One Who guides to the truth or those who cannot find the way unless guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge? </li>
          <li>Quran 13-14: Calling upon Him ˹alone˺ is the truth. But those ˹idols˺ the pagans invoke besides Him ˹can˺ never respond to them in any way. ˹It is˺ just like someone who stretches out their hands to water, ˹asking it˺ to reach their mouths, but it can never do so. The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain.</li>
          <li>Quran 14-12:  Why should we not put our trust in Allah, when He has truly guided us to ˹the very best of˺ ways? Indeed, we will patiently endure whatever harm you may cause us. And in Allah let the faithful put their trust.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-5: And He created the cattle for you as a source of warmth, food, and ˹many other˺ benefits. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-26: Indeed, those before them had plotted, but Allah struck at the ˹very˺ foundation of their structure, so the roof collapsed on top of them, and the torment came upon them from where they did not expect.1
          <li>Quran 16-73: Yet they worship besides Allah those ˹idols˺ who do not afford them any provision from the heavens and the earth, nor do they have the power to. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-81: And Allah has provided you shade out of what He created, and has given you shelter in the mountains. He has also provided you with clothes protecting you from the heat ˹and cold˺, and armour shielding you in battle. This is how He perfects His favour upon you, so perhaps you will ˹fully˺ submit ˹to Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-124: ˹Honouring˺ the Sabbath was ordained only for those who disputed about Abraham.1 And surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their disputes. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-126: If you retaliate, then let it be equivalent to what you have suffered. But if you patiently endure, it is certainly best for those who are patient. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-29:  Do not be so tight-fisted, for you will be blameworthy; nor so open-handed, for you will end up in poverty. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-62: There they will never hear any idle talk—only ˹greetings of˺ peace. And there they will have their provisions morning and evening.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 19-97: Indeed, We have made this ˹Quran˺ easy in your own language ˹O Prophet˺ so with it you may give good news to the righteous and warn those who are contentious. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 23: The wise, constantly cultivating Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice,
            being
            ever mindful and steadfastly striving, realize Nibbana: Nibbana, which is free from the bonds of yoga*;
            Nibbana, the Incomparable!</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 67: That deed is not well done, if one has to repent for having done it, and if, with a
            tearful face, one has to weep as a result of that deed. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Dhammika: "Bhikkhus, a wise man does not wish for wealth and prosperity by doing
            evil, whether it is for his own sake or for the sake of others. He only works for his own liberation from
            the round of rebirths (samsara) by comprehending the Dhamma and living according to the Dhamma."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 86: But those who practise according to the well-expounded Dhamma will reach the other
            shore (Nibbana), having passed the realm of Death (i.e., samsara), very difficult as it is to cross.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: "Bhikkhus, Sariputta's answer is simply this; he accepts the fact that
            Nibbana is realized by means of meditation on the senses, but his acceptance is due to his own personal
            realization and not merely because I have said it or somebody else has said it. Sariputta has faith in me;
            he also has faith in the consequences of good and bad deeds."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Padhanikatissa: To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! One who wants to teach others
            should first teach himself and conduct himself properly."</li>
          <li>The Story of Some Bhikkhus: The Buddha asked them, "Bhikkhus, have you attained Arahatta Phala?" Then they
            replied that they were in such a condition that it would not be difficult for them to attain Arahatta Phala
            at any time. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! Just because you are endowed with morality (sila), just
            because you have attained Anagami Phala, you should not be complacent and think that there is just a little
            more to be done; unless you have eradicated all moral intoxicants (asavas), you must not think that you have
            realized perfect bliss of Arahatta Fruition."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 315: As a border town is guarded both inside and outside, so guard yourself. Let not the
            right moment go by for those who miss this moment come to grief when they fall into niraya. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 333: It is good to have virtue till old age, it is good to have unshakable faith, it is
            good to gain wisdom, it is good to do no evil.</li>
          <li>The Story of Jatila, the Brahmin: But the Buddha rejected his view and said, "O brahmin, I do not call one
            a brahmana because he keeps his hair matted or simply because of his birth; I call one a brahmana only if he
            fully comprehends the Four Noble Truths."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 414: Him I call a brahmana, who, having traversed this dangerous swamp (of passion), this
            difficult road (of moral defilements), the ocean of life (samsara) and the darkness of ignorance (moha), and
            having crossed the fourfold Flood, has reached the other shore (Nibbana); who practises Tranquility and
            Insight Meditation, who is free from craving and from doubt, who clings to nothing and remains in perfect
            peace.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 416: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has given up craving, and leaving the
            home-life has become a bhikkhu; who has eradicated craving and has come to the end of existence.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 423: Him I call a brahmana, who knows past existences, who sees the celestial as well as
            the lower worlds, who has reached the end of rebirths, who, with Magga Insight, has become an arahat and has
            accomplished all that is to be accomplished for the eradication of moral defilements.</li>

          <li>Tsze-yu said, "The disciples and followers of Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in
            answering and replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished. But these are only the
            branches of learning, and they are left ignorant of what is essential.-How can they be acknowledged as
            sufficiently taught?" (C.A. quote 815) Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, "Alas! Yen Yu is wrong.
            According to the way of the superior man in teaching, what departments are there which he considers of
            prime
            importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of secondary importance, and allows himself to
            be idle about? But as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he deals
            with
            his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not the
            sage
            alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the consummation of learning?" (C.A. quote 816)</li>
          <li>It is from Music that the finish is recieved (C.A. quote 273)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Suppose the case of a man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to
            assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called perfectly virtuous?" The Master said, "Why speak
            only of virtue in connection with him? Must he not have the qualities of a sage? Even Yao and Shun were
            still solicitous about this (C.A. quote 207)</li>

          <li>The Story of the Woman Who Ate up the Eggs of a Hen: When the ogress arrived, the Buddha reprimanded both

            Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, "Shih goes beyond the
            due mean, and Shang does not come up to it." (C.A. quote 421) "Then," said Tsze-kung, "the superiority is
            with Shih, I suppose." (C.A. quote 422) The Master said, "To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short."

Even if the two armies had made an appointment ˹to meet˺, both would have certainly missed it.1 Still it transpired so Allah may establish what He had destined—that those who were to perish and those who were to survive might do so after the truth had been made clear to both. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing</li>
          <li>Quran 12-110: And when the messengers despaired and their people thought the messengers had been denied help, Our help came to them ˹at last˺. We then saved whoever We willed, and Our punishment is never averted from the wicked people. </li>

            Quran 1-2: All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-35: We cautioned, “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat as freely as you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-179: There is security of life for you in the law of retaliation, O people of reason, so that you may become mindful of Allah.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-180: It is prescribed that when death approaches any of you-if they leave something of value-a will should be made in favour of parents and immediate family with fairness. This is an obligation on those who are mindful of Allah.</li>
          <li>Quran 3-161: It is not appropriate for a prophet to illegally withhold spoils of war. And whoever does so, it will be held against them on the Day of Judgment. Then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-6: Test ˹the competence of˺ the orphans until they reach a marriageable age. Then if you feel they are capable of sound judgment, return their wealth to them. And do not consume it wastefully and hastily before they grow up ˹to demand it˺. If the guardian is well-off, they should not take compensation; but if the guardian is poor, let them take a reasonable provision. When you give orphans back their property, call in witnesses. And sufficient is Allah as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-7: For men there is a share in what their parents and close relatives leave, and for women there is a share in what their parents and close relatives leave—whether it is little or much. ˹These are˺ obligatory shares. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-8: If ˹non-inheriting˺ relatives, orphans,1 or the needy are present at the time of distribution, offer them a ˹small˺ provision from it and speak to them kindly. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-1: They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the spoils of war. Say, “Their distribution is decided by Allah and His Messenger. So be mindful of Allah, settle your affairs, and obey Allah and His Messenger if you are ˹true˺ believers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-41: Know that whatever spoils you take, one-fifth is for Allah and the Messenger, his close relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers, if you ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and what We revealed to Our servant on that decisive day when the two armies met ˹at Badr˺. And Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-74, 75: Those who believed, migrated, and struggled in the cause of Allah, and those who gave ˹them˺ shelter and help, they are the true believers. They will have forgiveness and an honourable provision.  And those who later believed, migrated, and struggled alongside you, they are also with you. But only blood relatives are now entitled to inherit from one another, as ordained by Allah. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything.1</li>
          <li>Quran 9-31: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Who owns ˹your˺ hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? And who conducts every affair?” They will ˹surely˺ say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 11-42, 43:  And ˹so˺ the Ark sailed with them through waves like mountains. Noah called out to his son, who stood apart, “O my dear son! Come aboard with us and do not be with the disbelievers.” He replied, “I will take refuge on a mountain, which will protect me from the water.” Noah cried, “Today no one is protected from Allah’s decree except those to whom He shows mercy!” And the waves came between them, and his son was among the drowned. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-66: Jacob insisted, “I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn oath by Allah that you will certainly bring him back to me, unless you are totally overpowered.” Then after they had given him their oaths, he concluded, “Allah is a Witness to what we have said.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-43: We did not send ˹messengers˺ before you ˹O Prophet˺ except mere men inspired by Us. If you ˹polytheists˺ do not know ˹this already˺, then ask those who have knowledge ˹of the Scriptures˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-33: Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right.1 If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs2 the authority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation,3 for they are already supported ˹by law˺. </li>

            constantly they remove the impurities of moral defilements."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 240: Just as rust is formed from iron, and corrodes the iron from which it is formed, so
            also, his own deeds lead the transgressor to a lower plane of existence (duggati). </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 283: O bhikkhus, cut down the forest of craving, not the real tree; the forest of craving
            breeds danger (of rebirth). Cut down the forest of craving as well as its undergrowth and be free from
            craving.
            Verse 284: So long as craving of man for woman is not cut down and the slightest trace of it remains, so
            long is his mind in bondage as the calf is bound to its mother.</li>

            free from dukkha.
            Verse 295: Having killed mother, father, the two brahmin kings and having destroyed the hindrances of which

            Verse 312: An act perfunctorily performed, or a practice that is depraved, or a questionable conduct of a
            bhikkhu is not of much benefit.
            Verse 313: If there is anything to be done, do it well; do it firmly and energetically; for the slack life
            of a bhikkhu scatters much dust (of moral defilements).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 369: O bhikkhu, bale out the water (of wrong thoughts) from this boat (your body); when

            Quran 3-179: Allah would not leave the believers in the condition you were in, until He distinguished the good from the evil ˹among you˺. Nor would Allah ˹directly˺ reveal to you the unseen,1 but He chooses whoever He wills as a messenger. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you are faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, you will receive a great reward. 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 6-59: With Him are the keys of the unseen—no one knows them except Him.1 And He knows what is in the land and sea. Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth or anything—green or dry—but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.2  </li>
          <li>Quran 7-72: So We saved him and those with him by Our mercy and uprooted those who denied Our signs. They were not believers. 
          <li>Quran 7-137: And ˹so˺ We made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands, which We had showered with blessings. ˹In this way˺ the noble Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they established. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-39: If you do not march forth, He will afflict you with a painful torment and replace you with other people. You are not harming Him in the least. And Allah is Most Capable of everything. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-109: Which is better: those who laid the foundation of their building on the fear and pleasure of Allah, or those who did so on the edge of a crumbling cliff that tumbled down with them into the Fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-3: Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,1 then established Himself on the Throne, conducting every affair. None can intercede except by His permission. That is Allah—your Lord, so worship Him ˹alone˺. Will you not then be mindful? </li>
          <li>Quran 10-4: To Him is your return all together. Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true. Indeed, He originates the creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-22: He is the One Who enables you to travel through land and sea. And it so happens that you are on ships, sailing with a favourable wind, to the passengers’ delight. Suddenly, the ships are overcome by a gale wind and those on board are overwhelmed by waves from every side, and they assume they are doomed. They cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion, “If You save us from this, we will certainly be grateful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-40: And when Our command came and the oven burst ˹with water˺,1 We said ˹to Noah˺, “Take into the Ark a pair from every species along with your family—except those against whom the decree ˹to drown˺ has already been passed—and those who believe.” But none believed with him except for a few. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-18: He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity. The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood. The ˹worthless˺ residue is then cast away, but what benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah sets forth parables. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-39: Allah eliminates and confirms what He wills, and with Him is the Master Record.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 15-19: As for the earth, We spread it out and placed upon it firm mountains, and caused everything to grow there in perfect balance. </li>

          <li>Quran 16-15: He has placed into the earth firm mountains, so it does not shake with you, as well as rivers, and pathways so you may find your way. 
          <li>Quran 16-45, 46, 47: Do those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them? Or that the torment will not come upon them in ways they cannot comprehend? Or that He will not seize them while they go about ˹their day˺, for then they will have no escape? Or that He will not destroy them gradually? But your Lord is truly Ever Gracious, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-68, 69: And your Lord inspired the bees: “Make ˹your˺ homes in the mountains, the trees, and in what people construct, and feed from ˹the flower of˺ any fruit ˹you please˺ and follow the ways your Lord has made easy for you.” From their bellies comes forth liquid of varying colours, in which there is healing for people. Surely in this is a sign for those who reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-92: Do not be like the woman who ˹foolishly˺ unravels her yarn after it is firmly spun, by taking your oaths as a means of deceiving one another in favour of a stronger group. Surely Allah tests you through this. And on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make your differences clear to you. 
          <li>Quran 18-96, 97: Bring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up ˹the gap˺ between the two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.” And so the enemies could neither scale nor tunnel through it. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-31, 32: And We have placed firm mountains upon the earth so it does not shake with them, and made in it broad pathways so they may find their way. And We have made the sky a well-protected canopy, still they turn away from its signs.1 </li>

But all matters are by Allah’s Will. Have the believers not yet realized that had Allah willed, He could have guided all of humanity? And disasters will continue to afflict the disbelievers or strike close to their homes for their misdeeds, until Allah’s promise comes to pass. Surely Allah never fails in His promise. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 36: The mind is very difficult to see, very delicate and subtle; it moves and lands
            wherever it pleases. The wise one should guard his mind, for a guarded mind brings happiness.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 39: If a man's mind is free from passion, if he is free from ill will, if he has

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 117: If a man does evil, he should not do it again and again; he should not take delight

            also, if latent craving is not rooted out, this dukkha (of birth, ageing and death) arises again and again.
            Verse 339: That man of wrong views, in whom the thirty-six streams (of craving) that flow towards
            pleasurable objects are strong, is carried away by his many thoughts connected with passion.
            Verse 340: The stream of craving flows towards all sense objects; the creeper of craving arises (at the six
            sense-doors) and fixes itself (on the six sense objects). Seeing that creeper of craving growing, cut off
            its roots with Magga Insight.
            Verse 341: In beings, there flows happiness that is smeared with craving; those beings attached to pleasure
            and seeking pleasure are, indeed, subject to birth and ageing.
            Verse 342: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare; held fast by fetters and
            bonds they undergo dukkha (round of rebirths) again and again, for a long time.
            Verse 343: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare. Therefore, One who wishes

We sent down abundant rain for them and made rivers flow at their feet. Then We destroyed them for their sins and replaced them with other peoples. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-84, 85: And We blessed him with Isaac and Jacob. We guided them all as We previously guided Noah and those among his descendants: David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron.

            Mindfulness is always praised, but negligence is always blamed.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 107: For a hundred years, a man may tend the sacred fire in the forest: yet if, only for
            a moment, one pays homage to a bhikkhu who has practised Insight Development, this homage is, indeed, better
            than a hundred years of making sacrifices (in fire-worship). </li>

            off not only because the slave girls said that you were not the thief but also because you did not steal and
            was therefore innocent. Those who do evil go to niraya, but those who do good are reborn in the deva worlds

            Verse 196: The merit gained by such a person who pays homage to those who have been freed from moral

          <li>The Story of Citta, the Householder: The Venerable Ananda, seeing how Citta's riches were being
            replenished, asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! is it only when Citta approached you that he is blessed with
            all these riches? Is he similarly blessed when he goes somewhere else?" To him the Buddha replied, "Ananda,
            this disciple is fully endowed with faith and generosity; he is also virtuous and his reputation spreads far
            and wide. Such a one is sure to be revered and showered with riches wherever he goes."</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera Samkicca: the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, if you rob or steal and commit all sorts of
            evil deeds, your life would be useless, even if you were to live a hundred years. Living a virtuous life
            even for a single day is much better than a hundred years of a life of depravity.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 110: Better than a hundred years in the life of an immoral person who has no control over
            his senses, is a day in the life of a virtuous person who cultivates Tranquillity and Insight Development
            Practice. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 122: One should not think lightly of doing good, imagining 'A little will not affect me';
            just as a water-jar is filled up by falling drops of rain, so also, the wise one is filled up with merit, by
            accumulating it little by little. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Raised by Thera Maha Moggallana: To him the Buddha answered, "My son, why do you
            ask? Have you not seen for yourself and heard what the devas said? You should not have any doubt. Little
            deeds of merit surely lead one to the world of the devas."</li>

          <li>Quran 5-5: Today all good, pure foods have been made lawful for you. Similarly, the food of the People of the Book1 is permissible for you and yours is permissible for them. And ˹permissible for you in marriage˺ are chaste believing women as well as chaste women of those given the Scripture before you—as long as you pay them their dowries in wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as mistresses. And whoever rejects the faith, all their good deeds will be void ˹in this life˺ and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 61: If a person seeking a companion cannot find one who is better than or equal to him,
            let him resolutely go on alone; there can be no companionship with a fool. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 78: One should not associate with bad friends, nor with the vile. One should associate
            with good friends, and with those who are noble. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 79: He who drinks in the Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind; the wise man always
            takes delight in the Dhamma (Bodhipakkhiya Dhamma) expounded by the Noble Ones (ariyas). </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Angulimala: Other bhikkhus asked the Buddha where Angulimala was reborn, and when the
            Buddha replied "My son has realized parinibbana", they could hardly believe it. So they asked him whether it
            was possible that a man who had killed so many people could have realized parinibbana. To this question, the
            Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Angulimala had done much evil because he did not have good friends. But later, he
            found good friends and through their help and good advice he had been steadfast and mindful in his practice
            of the dhamma. Therefore, his evil deeds have been overwhelmed by good (i e., Arahatta Magga).</li>
          <li>The Story of the Unrivalled Alms-Giving: On seeing the king, the Buddha said, "Great King! You should
            rejoice that you have succeeded in making the offering of the unrivalled charity (asadisadana). Such an
            opportunity comes very rarely; it comes only once during the appearance of each Buddha. But your minister
            Kala had felt that it was a waste, and was not at all appreciative. So, if I had given a lengthy discourse,
            he would get more and more dissatisfied and uncomfortable, and in consequence, he would suffer much more in
            the present existence as well as in the next. That was why I preached so briefly."
            Then the Buddha added, "Great King! Fools do not rejoice in the charities given by others and go to the
            lower worlds. The wise rejoice in other people's charities and through appreciation, they share in the merit
            gained by others and go to the abode of the devas".</li>
          <li>The Story of Nandiya: To him the Buddha said, "My son, why do you ask? Have you not yourself seen the
            mansion and riches waiting for Nandiya in the Tavatimsa deva world? The devas await the coming of the good
            and generous ones, as relatives await the return of one who is long absent. When the good ones die, they are
            welcomed joyously to the abode of the devas."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 328: If one finds a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one
            should live with him joyfully and mindfully, overcoming all dangers.
            Verse 329: If one cannot find a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one should live
            alone like the king who gave up and left the country he had won, and like the elephant Matanga roaming alone
            in the forest.
            Verse 330: It is better to live alone; there is no fellowship with a fool. So one should live alone, do no
            evil, and be carefree like the elephant Matanga roaming alone in the forest.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 331: It is good to have friends when the need arises; it is good to be content with
            anything that is available; it is good to have merit when life is about to end; it is good to be rid of all
            dukkha.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 354: The gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts; the taste of the Dhamma excels all tastes;
            delight in the Dhamma excels all delights. The eradication of Craving (i.e., attainment of arahatship)
            overcomes all ills (samsara dukkha).</li>
          <li>The Story of the Questions Raised by Sakka: At the end of the discourse, Sakka said to the Buddha,
            "Venerable Sir, if the gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts why are we not invited to share the merit
            whenever gifts of the Dhamma are made? Venerable Sir! I pray that, from now on, we may be given a share in
            the merit of good deeds".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 376: Associate with good friends, who are energetic and whose livelihood is pure; let him
            be amiable and be correct in his conduct. Then, (frequently) feeling much joy he will make an end of dukkha
            (of the round of rebirths).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 379: O bhikkhu, by yourself exhort yourself, and examine yourself; thus guarding yourself

            Verse 380: One indeed is one's own refuge, (how could anyone else be one's refuge?) One indeed is one's own

You are also forbidden to draw lots for decisions.1 This is all evil. Today the disbelievers have given up all hope of ˹undermining˺ your faith. So do not fear them; fear Me!

            grow into strong, vigorous plants or trees and will bear much fruit; but you had sown your seed in poor
            soil, so you reap poorly."</li>

          <li>Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, "It is to love all men." (C.A. quote 499)</li>
          <li>When the Master went to Weil Zan Yu acted as driver of his carriage. (C.A. quote 524) The Master
            observed,
            "How numerous are the people!" (C.A. quote 525) Yu said, "Since they are thus numerous, what more shall be
            done for them?" "Enrich them, was the reply. (C.A. quot 526) "And when they have been enriched, what more
            shall be done?" The Master said, "Teach them." (C.A. quote 527)</li>
          <li>The Master wishing to go and live among the nine tribes of the east (C.A. quote 315) Some one said,
            "They
            are rude, How can you do such a thing?" The master said, "If a superior man dwelt among them, what
            rudeness
            would there me? (C.A. quote 316) The Master said, "I returend from Wei to Lu, and the music transformed,
            and
            the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places (C.A. quote 317)</li>

          <li>Chi Lu asked about serving the spirits of the dead. The Master said, "While you are not able to serve
            men,
            how can you serve spirits?" Chi Lu added, "I venture to ask about death?" He was answered, "While you do
            not
            know life, how can you know about death?" (C.A. quote 413)</li>

            Quran 2-110: Establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will ˹certainly˺ find ˹its reward˺ with Allah. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Quran 2-195: Spend in the cause of Allah and do not let your own hands throw you into destruction by withholding. And do good, for Allah certainly loves the good-doers.

          <li>
            Quran 2-148: Everyone turns to their own direction ˹of prayer˺. So compete with one another in doing good. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together ˹for judgment˺. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-215: They ask you ˹O Prophet in˺ what ˹way˺ they should donate. Say, “Whatever donations you give are for parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers. Whatever good you do is certainly well known to Allah.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-262: Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah and do not follow their charity with reminders of their generosity or hurtful words—they will get their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-263: Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-264: O believers! Do not waste your charity with reminders ˹of your generosity˺ or hurtful words, like those who donate their wealth just to show off and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Their example is that of a hard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil hit by a strong rain—leaving it just a bare stone. Such people are unable to preserve the reward of their charity. Allah does not guide ˹such˺ disbelieving people. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-265: And the example of those who donate their wealth, seeking Allah’s pleasure and believing the reward is certain,1 is that of a garden on a fertile hill: when heavy rain falls, it yields up twice its normal produce. If no heavy rain falls, a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-273: ˹Charity is˺ for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of Allah to move about in the land ˹for work˺. Those unfamiliar with their situation will think they are not in need ˹of charity˺ because they do not beg. You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not beg people persistently. Whatever you give in charity is certainly well known to Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-92: You will never achieve righteousness until you donate some of what you cherish. And whatever you give is certainly well known to Allah. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-114: They believe in Allah and the Last Day, encourage good and forbid evil, and race with one another in doing good. They are ˹truly˺ among the righteous. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-103:  Take from their wealth ˹O Prophet˺ charity to purify and bless them, and pray for them—surely your prayer is a source of comfort for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-26:  Give to close relatives their due, as well as the poor and ˹needy˺ travellers. And do not spend wastefully. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-89, 90:  And ˹remember˺ when Zachariah cried out to his Lord, “My Lord! Do not leave me childless, though You are the Best of Successors.”1 So We answered his prayer, granted him John, and made his wife fertile. Indeed, they used to race in doing good, and call upon Us with hope and fear, totally humbling themselves before Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-28: so they may obtain the benefits ˹in store˺ for them,1 and pronounce the Name of Allah on appointed days over the sacrificial animals He has provided for them. So eat from their meat and feed the desperately poor. </li>

            Quran 2-140: Do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants were all Jews or Christians?” Say, “Who is more knowledgeable: you or Allah?” Who does more wrong than those who hide the testimony they received from Allah? And Allah is never unaware of what you do. 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-177: Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west. Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, needy travellers, beggars, and for freeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges they make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in the heat of battle. It is they who are true in faith, and it is they who are mindful of Allah.</li>
          <li>Quran 3-9: Our Lord! You will certainly gather all humanity for the ˹promised˺ Day—about which there is no doubt. Surely Allah does not break His promise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-67: Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian; he submitted in all uprightness1 and was not a polytheist. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-73, 74: And only believe those who follow your religion.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely, ˹the only˺ true guidance is Allah’s guidance.” ˹They also said,˺ “Do not believe that someone will receive ˹revealed˺ knowledge similar to yours or argue against you before your Lord.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, all bounty is in the Hands of Allah—He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.” He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.  </li>
          <li>Quran 3-81: ˹Remember˺ when Allah made a covenant with the prophets, ˹saying,˺ “Now that I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger1 confirming what you have, you must believe in him and support him.” He added, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” Allah said, “Then bear witness, and I too am a Witness.” </li>

          <li>Quran 4-1: O humanity! Be mindful of your Lord Who created you from a single soul, and from it He created its mate,1 and through both He spread countless men and women. And be mindful of Allah—in Whose Name you appeal to one another—and ˹honour˺ family ties. Surely Allah is ever Watchful over you. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-48: We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-79:  They did not forbid one another from doing evil. Evil indeed was what they did! </li>
          <li>Quran 6-69: Those mindful ˹of Allah˺ will not be accountable for those ˹who ridicule it˺ whatsoever—their duty is to advise, so perhaps the ridiculers will abstain. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-70: And leave those who take this1 faith ˹of Islam˺ as mere play and amusement and are deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life. Yet remind them by this ˹Quran˺, so no one should be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have no protector or intercessor other than Allah. Even if they were to offer every ˹possible˺ ransom, none will be accepted from them. Those are the ones who will be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have a boiling drink and painful punishment for their disbelief. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-90: These ˹prophets˺ were ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah, so follow their guidance. Say, “I ask no reward of you for this ˹Quran˺—it is a reminder to the whole world.” </li>

And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-164: When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-61: If the enemy is inclined towards peace, make peace with them. And put your trust in Allah. Indeed, He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-72: Those who believed, emigrated, and strived with their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them shelter and help—they are truly guardians of one another. As for those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no obligations to them until they emigrate. But if they seek your help ˹against persecution˺ in faith, it is your obligation to help them, except against people bound with you in a treaty. Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. 
          <li>Quran 9-6: And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection ˹O Prophet˺, grant it to them so they may hear the Word of Allah, then escort them to a place of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-19: Humanity was once nothing but a single community ˹of believers˺, but then they differed.1 Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,2 their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-65: When they opened their bags, they discovered that their money had been returned to them. They argued, “O our father! What more can we ask for? Here is our money, fully returned to us. Now we can buy more food for our family. We will watch over our brother, and obtain an extra camel-load of grain. That load can be easily secured.” </li>
          <li>Quran 12-94: When the caravan departed ˹from Egypt˺, their father said ˹to those around him˺, “You may think I am senile, but I certainly sense the smell of Joseph.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-36: ˹The believers among˺ those who were given the Scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, while some ˹disbelieving˺ factions deny a portion of it. Say, “I have only been commanded to worship Allah, associating none with Him ˹in worship˺. To Him I invite ˹all˺, and to Him is my return.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-52: This ˹Quran˺ is a ˹sufficient˺ message for humanity so that they may take it as a warning and know that there is only One God, and so that people of reason may be mindful. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-71: And Allah has favoured some of you over others in provision. But those who have been much favoured would not share their wealth with those ˹bondspeople˺ in their possession, making them their equals.1 Do they then deny Allah’s favours? </li>
          <li>Quran 16-118: To the Jews, We have forbidden what We related to you before.1 We did not wrong them, but it was they who wronged themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-3: ˹O˺ descendants of those We carried with Noah ˹in the Ark˺! He was indeed a grateful servant.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-71: ˹Beware of˺ the Day We will summon every people with their leader.1 So whoever will be given their record in their right hand will read it ˹happily˺ and will not be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-99: On that Day, We will let them1 surge ˹like waves˺ over one another. Later, the Trumpet will be blown,2 and We will gather all ˹people˺ together. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-107, 108: We have sent you ˹O Prophet˺ only as a mercy for the whole world.  Say, “What has been revealed to me is this: ‘Your God is only One God.’ Will you then submit?” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-27:  Call ˹all˺ people to the pilgrimage.1 They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel from every distant path, </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 98: In a village or in a forest, in a valley or on a hill, wherever arahats dwell, that
            place is delightful. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 344: Having left the forest of desire (i.e., the life of a householder), he takes to the
            forest of the practice (i.e., the life of a bhikkhu); but when he is free from the forest of desire he
            rushes back to that very forest. Come, look at that man who having become free rushes back into that very
            bondage. </li>
          <li>The Story of a Great Many Bhikkhus: The leader of the gang of thieves who was close at hand heard
            everything the lady had said and he was extremely surprised. Her words also kept him thinking, "If we take
            away the property of this wise and noble person, we will surely be punished; we might even be struck by
            lightning and our heads broken into many pieces." The leader got alarmed over this possibility and he
            hurried back to the house of the lady and made his followers return all the things they had taken. He then
            took all his followers to where the mistress of the house was; she was still at the pavilion, listening
            attentively to the Dhamma.</li>

          <li>Quran 18-110: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a man like you, ˹but˺ it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God. So whoever hopes for the meeting with their Lord, let them do good deeds and associate none in the worship of their Lord.” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-26: And ˹remember˺ when We assigned to Abraham the site of the House, ˹saying,˺ “Do not associate anything with Me ˹in worship˺ and purify My House for those who circle ˹the Ka’bah˺, stand ˹in prayer˺, and bow and prostrate themselves. </li>
          <li>QUran 22-30: That is so. And whoever honours the rituals of Allah, it is best for them in the sight of their Lord. The ˹meat of˺ cattle has been made lawful for you, except what has ˹already˺ been recited to you.1 So shun the impurity of idolatry, and shun words of falsehood. </li>

          <li>The Story of Thera Nataputtaka: One day, while the Buddha and the bhikkhus including Nataputtaka were
            going on an alms-round, they came across the son of another dancer dancing in the street. Seeing the young

          <li>The head of the Chi family was going to attack Chwan-yu. (C.A. quote 689) Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an
            interview with Confucius, and said, "Our chief, Chil is going to commence operations against Chwan-yu."
            (C.A. quote 690) Confucius said, "Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault here? (C.A. 691) Now, in regard to
            Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern Mang;
            moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our state; and its ruler is a minister in direct
            connection
            with the sovereign; What has your chief to do with attacking it?" (C.A. quote 692) Zan Yu said, "Our
            master
            wishes the thing; neither of us two ministers wishes it." (C.A. quote 693) Confucius said, "Ch'iu, there
            are
            the words of Chau Zan, -'When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in the ranks of office;
            when
            he finds himself unable to do so, he retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, who
            does
            not support him when tottering, nor raise him up when fallen?' (C.A. quote 694) "And further, you speak
            wrongly. When a tiger or rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of jade is injured in
            its repository:-whose is the fault?" (C.A. quote 695) Zan Yu said, "But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and
            near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a sorrow to his descendants." (C.A.
            quote
            696) Confucius said. "Ch'iu, the superior man hates those declining to say-'I want such and such a thing,'
            and framing explanations for their conduct. (C.A. quote 697)</li>
          <li>The duke Ching of Chi'i, with reference to the manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, "I
            cannot
            treat him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to
            the

            happiness, will find happiness in his next existence.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 197: Indeed we live very happily, not hating anyone among those who hate; among men who
            hate we live without hating anyone.

          <li>The Story of Sundari the Wandering Female Ascetic: The king then ordered them to go round the town and
            confess their guilt to the people. So they went round the town saying, "We are the ones who killed Sundari.
            We have falsely accused the disciples of Gotama just to bring disgrace on Gotama. The disciples of Gotama
            are innocent, only we are guilty of the crime." As a result of this episode, the power, the glory and the

            and talents." (C.A. quote 509)</li>
          <li>Chung-ung said, "How shall I know the men of virtue and talent, so that I may raise them to office?" He

            them? (C.A. quote 510)</li>

            talents for every employment." (C.A. quote 802)</li>
          <li>Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched. (C.A. quote 840)</li>

          <li>When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish . When proprieties
            and

            the people do not know how to move hand or foot (C.A. quote 516)</li>
          <li>If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in

          <li>Tsze-chang asked Confucius saying, "In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may
            conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the
            four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang said, "What are meant by the five
            excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without the great
            expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining (feel or express discontent; fret);
            when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being
            proud; when he is majestic without being fierce." (C.A. quote 846) Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by
            being
            beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more
            beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent
            without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who
            will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of
            covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not
            dare
            to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his
            clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with
            awe;-is
            not this to be majestic without being fierce?" (C.A. quote 848)</li>
          <li>Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, saying, "What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the
            good of the principled?" Confucius replied, "Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use
            killing
            at all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be good. The relation between
            superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind
            blows across it." (C.A. quote 489)</li>

          <li>Quran 2-54: And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Surely you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf, so turn in repentance to your Creator and execute ˹the calf-worshippers among˺ yourselves. That is best for you in the sight of your Creator.” Then He accepted your repentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-124: ˹Remember˺ when Abraham was tested by his Lord with ˹certain˺ commandments, which he fulfilled. Allah said, “I will certainly make you into a role model for the people.” Abraham asked, “What about my offspring?” Allah replied, “My covenant is not extended to the wrongdoers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-193: Fight against them if they persecute you until there is no more persecution, and your devotion will be to Allah alone. If they stop persecuting you, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-213: Humanity had once been one community ˹of believers before they lost faith˺. Then Allah raised prophets as deliverers of good news and as warners, and revealed to them the Scriptures in truth to judge among people regarding their disputes. And no one disputed the Scriptures except the very people who received them after clear proofs had come to them—out of jealousy. Then Allah, by His grace, has guided the believers to the truth regarding those disputes. And Allah guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-225: Allah will not hold you accountable for unintentional oaths, but for what you intended in your hearts. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-282: O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her.1 The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing ˹contracts˺ for a fixed period—whether the sum is small or great. This is more just ˹for you˺ in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded ˹your limits˺. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah ˹is the One Who˺ teaches you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-159: It is out of Allah’s mercy that you ˹O Prophet˺ have been lenient with them. Had you been cruel or hard-hearted, they would have certainly abandoned you. So pardon them, ask Allah’s forgiveness for them, and consult with them in ˹conducting˺ matters. Once you make a decision, put your trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves those who trust in Him. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-195: So their Lord responded to them: “I will never deny any of you—male or female—the reward of your deeds. Both are equal in reward. Those who migrated or were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted for My sake and fought and ˹some˺ were martyred—I will certainly forgive their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a reward from Allah. And with Allah is the finest reward!” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-2: Give orphans their wealth ˹when they reach maturity˺, and do not exchange your worthless possessions for their valuables, nor cheat them by mixing their wealth with your own. For this would indeed be a great sin. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-5: Do not entrust the incapable ˹among your dependants˺ with your wealth which Allah has made a means of support for you—but feed and clothe them from it, and speak to them kindly. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-58: Indeed, Allah commands you to return trusts to their rightful owners;1 and when you judge between people, judge with fairness. What a noble commandment from Allah to you! Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-88: Why are you ˹believers˺ divided into two groups regarding the hypocrites while Allah allowed them to regress ˹to disbelief˺ because of their misdeeds? Do you wish to guide those left by Allah to stray? And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way. 
          <li>Quran 4-90: except those who are allies of a people you are bound with in a treaty or those wholeheartedly opposed to fighting either you or their own people. If Allah had willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. So if they refrain from fighting you and offer you peace, then Allah does not permit you to harm them. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-161: ˹All were˺ messengers delivering good news and warnings so humanity should have no excuse before Allah after ˹the coming of˺ the messengers. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-54: O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, Allah will replace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be humble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in the Way of Allah; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-107, 108: If they are found guilty ˹of false testimony˺, let the deceased’s two closest heirs affected by the bequest replace the witnesses and testify under oath ˹saying˺, “By Allah! Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have not transgressed. Otherwise, we would surely be wrongdoers.” In this way it is more likely that witnesses will give true testimony or else fear that their oaths could be refuted by those of the heirs. Be mindful of Allah and obey. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-52: ˹O Prophet!˺ Do not dismiss those ˹poor believers˺ who invoke their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure.1 You are not accountable for them whatsoever, nor are they accountable for you. So do not dismiss them, or you will be one of the wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-131: This ˹sending of the messengers˺ is because your Lord would never destroy a society for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware ˹of the truth˺. </li>

          <li>The Story of Kukkutamitta: The bhikkhus then asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir, is the wife of the hunter
            who is a sotapanna, also not guilty of taking life, if she has been getting things like nets, bows and
            arrows for her husband when he goes out hunting?" To this question the Buddha answered, "Bhikkhus, the
            sotapannas do not kill, they do not wish others to get killed. The wife of the hunter was only obeying her
            husband in getting things for him. Just as the hand that has no wound is not affected by poison, so also,
            because she has no intention to do evil she is not doing any evil."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 124: If there is no wound on the hand, one may handle poison; poison does not affect one
            who has no wound; there can be no evil for one who has no evil intention. </li>
          <li>The Story of Koka the Huntsman: The Buddha said, "My son, rest assured and have no doubt; you are not
            responsible for the death of the hunter; your morality (sila) is also not soiled on account of that death.
            Indeed, that huntsman did a great wrong to one whom he should do no wrong and so had come to this grievous
            end."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 125: If one wrongs a person who should not be wronged, one who is pure and is free from
            moral defilements, viz., an arahat, the evil falls back upon that fool, like fine dust thrown against the
            wind. </li>
          <li>
            The Story of the Judge: They reported the matter to the Buddha and the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! In
            deciding cases, if one is influenced by affection or by monetary consideration, he cannot be called 'the
            just', or 'a judge who abides by the law.' If one weighs the evidence intelligently and decides a case
            impartially, then he is to be called, 'the just' or 'a judge who abides by the law.'"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 256: He is not just if he decides a case arbitrarily; the wise man should decide after
            considering both what is right and what is wrong.</li>

            hated by all the people of his neighborhood?" The Master said, "We may not for that conclude that he is
            bad.

            But a superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not enjoy pleasant food which he may eat,
            nor
            derive pleasure from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if he is comfortably lodged.

            then went out, and the Master said, "This shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years
            old that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three years' mourning is universally
            observed throughout the empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his parents?" (C.A. 769)</li>

          <li>Tsze-kung asked, saying, "What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The

            will
            not disgrace his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer." (C.A. quote 544)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu asked, saying, "What qualities must a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?" The

          <li>Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain alters, said, "I venture to ask how to

            "Truly a good question!" (C.A. quote 497) "If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and
            success a secondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assail one's own wickedness and

          <li>Quran 2-36:  But Satan deceived them—leading to their fall from the ˹blissful˺ state they were in,1 and We said, “Descend from the heavens ˹to the earth˺ as enemies to each other.2 You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-134: That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-139: Say, “Would you dispute with us about Allah, while He is our Lord and your Lord? We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. And we are devoted to Him ˹alone˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-141: That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-173: He has only forbidden you to eat carrion, blood, swine, and what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity-neither driven by desire nor exceeding immdiate need-they will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-178: O believers! The law of retaliation is set for you in cases of murder-a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if the offender is pardoned by the victim's guardian, then blood-money should be decided fairly and payment should be made courteously. This is a concession and mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgreses after that will suffer a painful punishment.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-190: Fight in the cause of Allah only against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-191: Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them--that is the reward of the disbelievers.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-192: But if they cease, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-219: They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about intoxicants and gambling. Say, “There is great evil in both, as well as some benefit for people—but the evil outweighs the benefit.”1 They ˹also˺ ask you ˹O Prophet˺ what they should donate. Say, “Whatever you can spare.” This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you ˹believers˺, so perhaps you may reflect </li>
          <li>Quran 2-233: ˹Divorced˺ mothers will breastfeed their offspring for two whole years, for those who wish to complete the nursing ˹of their child˺. The child’s father will provide reasonable maintenance and clothing for the mother ˹during that period˺. No one will be charged with more than they can bear. No mother or father should be made to suffer for their child. The ˹father’s˺ heirs are under the same obligation. But if both sides decide—after mutual consultation and consent—to wean a child, then there is no blame on them. If you decide to have your children nursed by a wet-nurse, it is permissible as long as you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-236: make (a marriage or relationship) complete by having sexual intercourse.</li>

          <li>Quran 4-4: Give women ˹you wed˺ their due dowries graciously. But if they waive some of it willingly, then you may enjoy it freely with a clear conscience. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-15: ˹As for˺ those of your women who commit illegal intercourse—call four witnesses from among yourselves. If they testify, confine the offenders to their homes until they die or Allah ordains a ˹different˺ way for them. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-25: But if any of you cannot afford to marry a free believing woman, then ˹let him marry˺ a believing bondwoman possessed by one of you. Allah knows best ˹the state of˺ your faith ˹and theirs˺. You are from one another.1 So marry them with the permission of their owners,2 giving them their dowry in fairness, if they are chaste, neither promiscuous nor having secret affairs. If they commit indecency after marriage, they receive half the punishment of free women.3 This is for those of you who fear falling into sin. But if you are patient, it is better for you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </li> 
          <li>Quran 4-34: Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with.1 And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds, ˹but if they still persist,˺ then discipline them ˹gently˺.2 But if they change their ways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-92:  It is not lawful for a believer to kill another except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer unintentionally must free a believing slave and pay blood-money to the victim’s family—unless they waive it charitably. But if the victim is a believer from a hostile people, then a believing slave must be freed. And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months—as a means of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-95: O  believers! Do not kill game while on pilgrimage. Whoever kills game intentionally must compensate by offering its equivalence—as judged by two just men among you—to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting so that they may taste the consequences of their violations. Allah has forgiven what has been done. But those who persist will be punished by Allah. And Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-58: Say ˹also˺, “If what you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter between us would have already been settled. But Allah knows the wrongdoers best.” </li>
          <li>Quran 6-164: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Should I seek a lord other than Allah while He is the Lord of everything?” No one will reap except what they sow. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of your differences. </li>

          <li>Quran 9-7: How can such polytheists have a treaty with Allah and His Messenger, except those you have made a treaty with at the Sacred Mosque?1 So, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Indeed Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-11: But if they repent, perform prayer, and pay alms-tax, then they are your brothers in faith. This is how We make the revelations clear for people of knowledge. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-85: And let neither their wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this world, and ˹then˺ their souls will depart while they are disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-106: And some others are left for Allah’s decision, either to punish them or turn to them in mercy.1 And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</li>
          <li>Quran 10-13: We surely destroyed ˹other˺ peoples before you when they did wrong, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they would not believe! This is how We reward the wicked people. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-30: Then and there every soul will face ˹the consequences of˺ what it had done. They all will be returned to Allah—their True Master. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them. 
          <li>Quran 14-7: And ˹remember˺ when your Lord proclaimed, ‘If you are grateful, I will certainly give you more. But if you are ungrateful, surely My punishment is severe.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-15: Whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And We would never punish ˹a people˺ until We have sent a messenger ˹to warn them˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-47: We will set up the scales of justice on the Day of Judgment, so no soul will be wronged in the least. And ˹even˺ if a deed is the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-17: Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians,1 Christians, Magi,2 and the polytheists—Allah will judge between them ˹all˺ on Judgment Day. Surely Allah is a Witness over all things. </li>

            bhikkhus to attain arahatship, approached the Buddha and asked a question, solely for the benefit of those
            bhikkhus. The question was this: "What are the two dhammas?" To this the Buddha replied, "Sariputta!
            Tranquillity and Insight Meditation are the two dhammas."</li>

            If the scholar be not grave he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid.

          <li>
            If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of
            others (C.A. quote 48) </li>
          <li>Let me return! Let me return! The little children of my school are ambitious and too hasty. They are
            accomplished and complete so far, but they do not know how to restrict and shape themselves (C.A. quote
            163)
          </li>
          <li>The leaving virtue without proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is learned; not being
            able to move towards righteousness of which a knowledge is gained; and not being able to change what is
            not
            good:-these are the things which occasion me solicitude (C.A. quote 212)</li>
          <li>From the man bringing his bundle of dried flesh for my teaching upwards, I have never refused
            instruction
            to anyone (C.A. quote 219)</li>
          <li>I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not
            anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from
            it
            learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson (C.A. quote 220)</li>
          <li>There were four things which the Master taught, -letters, ethics, devotion of soul, and truthfulness
            (C.A.
            quote 241)</li>
          <li>I admit people's approach to me without committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired.
            Why must one be so severe? If a man purify himself to wait upon me, I receive him so purified, without
            guaranteeing his past conduct (C.A. quote 248)</li>
          <li>Yen Yuan, in admiration of the Master's doctrines, sighed and said, "I looked up to them, and they
            seemed
            to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them
            before
            me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind (C.A. quote 308)</li>
          <li>"The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught
            me
            the restraints of propriety (C.A. quote 309) </li>
          <li>When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability,
            there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I
            really
            find no way to do so (C.A. quote 310)</li>

          <li>The Master said, "He is no disciple of mine. My little children, beat the drum and assail him (C.A.
            quote
            425)</li>
          <li>Let a good man teach the people seven years, and they may then likewise be employed in war (C.A. quote
            558)</li>
          <li>In teaching there should be no distinction of classes (C.A. quote 683)</li>
          <li>Those whose courses are different cannot lay plans for one another (C.A. quote 684)</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: The Buddha was satisfied with the explanation given by the Venerable
            Sariputta and said to the other bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus! The Venerable Sariputta was not worshipping the various
            directions; he was only paying obeisance to his teacher and benefactor, through whom he had attained the
            Deathless. It is quite right and proper for him to pay homage to such a teacher."</li>

We surely see you as one of the good-doers.” Joseph responded, “Allah forbid that we should take other than the one with whom we found our property. Otherwise, we would surely be unjust.” When they lost all hope in him, they spoke privately. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father had taken a solemn oath by Allah from you, nor how you failed him regarding Joseph before? So I am not leaving this land until my father allows me to, or Allah decides for me. For He is the Best of Judges. Return to your father and say, ‘O our father! Your son committed theft. We testify only to what we know. We could not guard against the unforeseen.1 Ask ˹the people of˺ the land where we were and the caravan we travelled with. We are certainly telling the truth.’”  He cried, “No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something ˹evil˺. So ˹I am left with nothing but˺ beautiful patience!1 I trust Allah will return them all to me. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.” He turned away from them, lamenting, “Alas, poor Joseph!” And his eyes turned white out of the grief he suppressed.1 They said, “By Allah! You will not cease to remember Joseph until you lose your health or ˹even˺ your life.” He replied, “I complain of my anguish and sorrow only to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know. O  my sons! Go and search ˹diligently˺ for Joseph and his brother. And do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah, for no one loses hope in Allah’s mercy except those with no faith.” When they entered Joseph’s presence, they pleaded, “O Chief Minister! We and our family have been touched with hardship, and we have brought only a few worthless coins, but ˹please˺ give us our supplies in full and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.” He asked, “Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?” Joseph said, “There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most Merciful of the merciful!</li>
          <li>Quran 12-100: Then he raised his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration to Joseph,1 who then said, “O my dear father! This is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true. He was truly kind to me when He freed me from prison, and brought you all from the desert after Satan had ignited rivalry between me and my siblings.2 Indeed my Lord is subtle in fulfilling what He wills. Surely He ˹alone˺ is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-16: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “Allah!” Ask ˹them˺, “Why ˹then˺ have you taken besides Him lords who cannot even benefit or protect themselves?” Say, “Can the blind and the sighted be equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?”1 Or have they associated with Allah partners who ˹supposedly˺ produced a creation like His, leaving them confused between the two creations?

      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 5: Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by
            loving-kindness. This is an ancient law.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 227: It is not new, O Atula! It has always been done from ancient times. They blame one
            who is silent, they blame one who speaks much, they blame one who speaks little. There is no one in this
            world who is not blamed.


            Verse 228: There never has been, there never will be, nor is there now, anyone who is always blamed or
            always praised.


            Verses 229 - 230: If the wise praise him day after day, knowing him to be truly faultless, wise and endowed
            with knowledge and virtue, who would blame him, who is like a nikkha of pure gold? The devas praise him; he
            is praised even by the great Brahmas.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest
            their
            actions should not come up to them (C.A. quote 128)</li>
          <li>A transmitter and not a maker, believing in and loving the ancients, I venture to compare myself with
            our
            old P'ang (C.A. quote 210)</li>
          <li>In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to
            the
            approbation of others." (C.A. qute 598)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang said, "What is meant when the Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial
            mourning, was for three years without speaking?" (C.A. quote 625) The Master said, "Why must Kao-tsung be
            referred to as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the sovereign died, the officers all
            attended to their several duties, taking instructions from the prime minister for three years." (C.A.
            quote
            626) The Master said, "When rulers love to observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to
            the
            calls on them for service." (C.A. quote 627)</li>
          <li>Anciently, men had three failings, which now perhaps are not to be found. (C.A. quote 757) The
            high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the
            present day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity showed itself in grave reserve;
            the
            stern dignity of the present day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. The stupidity of antiquity
            showed
            itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity of the present day shows itself in sheer deceit." (C.A. quote

          <li>Quran 10-79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90: Pharaoh demanded, “Bring me every skilled magician.” When the magicians came, Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you wish to cast!” And Allah establishes the truth by His Words—even to the dismay of the wicked.” But no one believed in Moses except a few youths of his people, while fearing that Pharaoh and their own chiefs might persecute them. And certainly Pharaoh was a tyrant in the land, and he was truly a transgressor.  Moses said, “O my people! If you do believe in Allah and submit ˹to His Will˺, then put your trust in Him. They replied, “In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Do not subject us to the persecution of the oppressive people, and deliver us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.” We revealed to Moses and his brother, “Appoint houses for your people in Egypt. Turn these houses into places of worship, establish prayer, and give good news to the believers!” Moses prayed, “Our Lord! You have granted Pharaoh and his chiefs luxuries and riches in this worldly life, ˹which they abused˺ to lead people astray from Your Way! Our Lord, destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.” Allah responded ˹to Moses and Aaron˺,1 “Your prayer is answered! So be steadfast and do not follow the way of those who do not know.” We brought the Children of Israel across the sea. Then Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them unjustly and oppressively. But as Pharaoh was drowning, he cried out, “I believe that there is no god except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am ˹now˺ one of those who submit.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-101, 102, 103, 104: We surely gave Moses nine clear signs.1 ˹You, O  Prophet, can˺ ask the Children of Israel. When Moses came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “I really think that you, O  Moses, are bewitched.” Moses replied, “You know well that none has sent these ˹signs˺ down except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as insights. And I really think that you, O  Pharaoh, are doomed.” So Pharaoh wanted to scare the Israelites out of the land ˹of Egypt˺, but We drowned him and all of those with him. And We said to the Children of Israel after Pharaoh, “Reside in the land, but when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass,1 We will bring you all together.” </li>

          <li>The Story of Three Ascetics: Other bhikkhus reported their behaviour to the Buddha and he called them to
            his presence, and said to them, "Once you have joined the Order, you should no longer stay together like a
            family. Not seeing those who are dear, and seeing those who are not dear to one, are both painful; so you
            should not hold any being or anything dear to you</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 212: Affection begets sorrow, affection begets fear. For him who is free from affection
            there is no sorrow; how can there be fear for him? /li>
          <li>The Story of Mara: But Rahula was unmoved. The Buddha, from his chamber, knew what was happening, and
            said, "O wicked Mara! Even a thousand such as you would not be able to frighten my son. My son has no fear,

He is certainly not of your family—he was entirely of unrighteous conduct. So do not ask Me about what you have no knowledge of! I warn you so you do not fall into ignorance.” Noah pleaded, “My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking You about what I have no knowledge of, and unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.” </li>

          <li>The music master, Mien, having called upon him, when they came to the steps, the Master said, "here are

            Verse 310: Thus, there is the acquisition of demerit, and there is rebirth in the evil apaya realms. The

You may eat and drink until you see the light of dawn breaking the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall.

            (chamber) of the heart. Those who control their mind will be free from the bonds of Mara.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 40: Knowing that this body is (fragile) like an earthern jar, making one's mind secure
            like a fortified town, one should fight Mara with the weapon of Knowledge. (After defeating Mara) one
            should
            still continue to guard one's mind, and feel no attachment to that which has been gained (i.e., jhana
            ecstasy and serenity gained through meditation).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 27: Therefore, one should not be negligent, nor be addicted to sensual pleasures; for

          <li>The Story of a Woman: The Buddha saw him from his monastery, and with his supernormal power, sent rays of
            light to him, and the bhikkhu received this message, which said, "My son, where worldlings seek sensual
            pleasures is not the place for bhikkhus; bhikkhus should take delight in forests where worldlings find no
            pleasure."</li>
          <li>The Story of Khanu-Kondanna: "To live for a hundred years in ignorance, doing foolish things, is useless;
            now that you have seen the Truth and have become wise, your life of one day as a wise man is much more
            worthwhile.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Pilotikatissa: But the Buddha refuted them, and said, "Bhikkhus! Pilotikatissa is not
            telling lies, he speaks the truth. Though he had relationship with his teacher previously, now he has no
            relationship whatsoever with his teacher. Thera Pilotikatissa has instructed himself to differentiate right
            and wrong causes and to discern the true nature of things. He has now become an arahat, and so there is no
            further connection between him and his teacher."</li>

            Verse 156: They, who in youth have neither led the Life of Purity nor have acquired wealth, lie helplessly

          <li>
            The Story of a Young Bhikkhu: The Buddha knew that the bhikkhu was then in a receptive mood and so he said,
            "To smile
            with sensual desire is ignoble; it is not right and proper to have ignoble thoughts."</li>

          <li>The Story of a Man Whose Wife Committed Adultery: On learning the reason for his absence, the Buddha said,
            "My disciple, women are just like a river, or a road, or a liquor shop or a rest house, or a water-pot stand
            at the roadside; they associate with all sorts of people. Indeed, sexual misconduct is the cause of ruin for

            only be perceived by wisdom. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Tissa the Idle One: On hearing about the above incident the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, one

            (jhana) and Magga Insight."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 281: One should be careful in speech, be well-restrained in mind, and physically, too,

            Path of Eight Constituents made known by the Buddhas. </li>

          <li>The Story of Culadhanuggaha, the Skilful Archer: The Buddha called the young bhikkhu to his presence and

            previous existence. In one of your previous existences you were a very skilful archer and she was your wife.
            On one occasion, while the two of you were travelling, you came upon a gang of highwaymen. She fell in love
            with the gang leader. So, while you and the gang leader were engaged in fighting and you called out to her
            to give you the sword, she gave the sword to the robber who promptly killed you. Thus, she was the cause of
            your death. Now, too, she will be the cause of your ruin if you go after her and leave my Order for her
            sake."</li>

            "This, indeed, is suffering."</li>

          <li>Quran 16-90: Indeed, Allah commands justice, grace, as well as courtesy to close relatives. He forbids indecency, wickedness, and aggression. He instructs you so perhaps you will be mindful. 
          <li>Quran 17-23: Do not set up any other god with Allah, or you will end up condemned, abandoned. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-23, 24: For your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And honour your parents. If one or both of them reach old age in your care, never say to them ˹even˺ ‘ugh,’ nor yell at them. Rather, address them respectfully. And be humble with them out of mercy, and pray, “My Lord! Be merciful to them as they raised me when I was young.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-75:  and then We truly would have made you taste double ˹punishment˺ both in this life and after death, and you would have found no helper against Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 25: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ thought that the people of the cave and the plaque1 were ˹the only˺ wonders of Our signs?, ˹Remember˺ when those youths took refuge in the cave, and said, “Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Yourself and guide us rightly through our ordeal.” So We caused them to fall into a dead sleep1 in the cave for many years, then We raised them so We may show which of the two groups would make a better estimation of the length of their stay.1  We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ their story in truth. They were youths who truly believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.  And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.”  And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and declared, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call upon any god besides Him, or we would truly be uttering an outrageous lie.” ˹Then they said to one another,˺ “These people of ours have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce a clear proof of them? Who then does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah? Since you have distanced yourselves from them and what they worship besides Allah, take refuge in the cave. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and accommodate you in your ordeal.” And you would have seen the sun, as it rose, inclining away from their cave to the right, and as it set, declining away from them to the left, while they lay in its open space.1 That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor. And you would have thought they were awake,1 though they were asleep. We turned them over, to the right and left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. Had you looked at them, you would have certainly fled away from them, filled with horror. That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour.1 When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth ˹after their death˺,2 some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.”  They had remained in their cave for three hundred years, adding nine.1</li>
          <li>Quran 20-16: So do not let those who disbelieve in it and follow their desires distract you from it, or you will be doomed.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-130: So be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset, and glorify Him in the hours of the night and at both ends of the day,1 so that you may be pleased ˹with the reward˺. </li>

      <h4>The prophets on discernment of actions</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>The Story of the Boa Constrictor Peta: The Buddha also said he himself had also seen that very peta soon
            after he had attained Buddhahood, but that he did not say anything about it because people might not believe
            him and thus they would be doing a great wrong to the Buddha. So out of compassion for these beings, the
            Buddha had kept silent. Then he continued, "Now that I have a witness in Moggallana, I will tell you about
            this boa constrictor peta. This peta was a thief during the time of Kassapa Buddha. As a thief and a
            cruel-hearted man, he had set fire to the house of a rich man seven times. And not satisfied with that, he
            also set fire to the perfumed hall donated by the same rich man to Kassapa Buddha, while Kassapa Buddha was
            out on an alms-round. As a result of those evil deeds he had suffered for a long time in niraya. Now, while
            serving out his term of suffering as a peta, he is being burnt with sparks of flames going up and down the
            length of his body. Bhikkhus, fools when doing evil deeds do not know them as being evil; but they cannot
            escape the evil consequences"</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 305: He who sits alone, lies down alone, walks alone, in diligent practice, and alone
            tames himself should find delight in living in the forest. </li>
          <li>The Story of an Ex-Bhikkhu: The Venerable Mahakassapa saw his pupil as he was being led out and said to
            him, "My pupil, keep your mind steadfastly on a subject of meditation." As instructed, he concentrated and
            let himself be established in deep mental absorption. At the cemetery, while the executioners were making
            preparations to kill him, the ex-bhikkhu was very much composed and showed no signs of fear or anxiety. The
            executioners and the onlookers were awe-struck and very much impressed by the man's courage and composure
            and they reported about him to the king and also to the Buddha.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 347: Beings who are infatuated with lust, fall back into the Stream of Craving they have
            generated, just as a spider does in the web it has spun. The Wise, cutting off the bond of craving, walk on
            resolutely, leaving, all ills (dukkha) behind. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Such an one will not enter a tottering state, nor dwell in a disorganized one. When right principles of
            government prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are prostrated, he will keep concealed
            (C.A. quote 279)</li>
          <li>When the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments
            of
            full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he
            would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily (C.A. quote 307)</li>
          <li>Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, "There
            are
            your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-why should you act on that principle of immediately
            carrying
            into practice what you hear?" Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice
            what
            he heard, and the Master answered, "Immediately carry into practice what you hear." Kung-hsi Hwa said, "Yu
            asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and Yu said, 'There are your father
            and elder brothers to be consulted.' Chi'u asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he
            heard, and Yu said, 'Carry it immediately into practice.' I, Chi'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you
            for an explanation." The Master said, "Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore I urged him forward. Yu has
            more than his own share of energy; therefore I kept him back."</li>

          <li>The Kung-po Liao, having slandered Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu, Ching-po informed Confucius of it,
            saying,
            "Our master is certainly being led astray by the Kung-po Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut
            Liao off, and expose his corpse in the market and in the court." (C.A. quote 617) The Master said, "If my
            principles are to advance, it is so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. What can
            the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is concerned?" (C.A. quote 618) The Master said, "Some men of
            worth
            retire from the world. Some retire from particular states. Some retire because of disrespectful looks.
            Some
            retire because of contradictory language." (C.A. quote 619) The Master said, "Those who have done this are
            seven men." (C.A. quote 620)</li>

          <li>Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his state, he was
            like
            an arrow. When bad government prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When
            good
            government prevails in his state, his is to be found in office. When bad government prevails, he can roll
            his principles up, and keep them in his breast." (C.A. quote 644)</li>
          <li>When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. When a man may not
            be spoken with, to speak to him is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to
            their
            man nor to their words (C.A. quote 645)</li>

          <li>A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and his
            vistors. Some one asked about him, saying, "I suppose he has made great progress." (C.A. quote 630) The
            Master said, "I observe that he fond of occupying the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks
            shoulder to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to make progress in learning. He wishes
            quickly to become a man." (C.A. quote 631)</li>

          <li>Tsze-lu said, "Does the superior man esteem valor?" The Master said, "The superior man holds
            righteousness
            to be of highest importance. A man in a superior situation, having valor without righteousness, will be
            guilty of insubordination; one of the lower people having valor without righteousness, will commit
            robbery."

          <li>Quran 2-283: If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security can be taken. If you trust one another, then ˹there is no need for a security, but˺ the debtor should honour this trust ˹by repaying the debt˺—and let them fear Allah, their Lord. And do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are indeed sinful. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-184: If you are rejected by them, so too were messengers before you who came with clear proofs, divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 4-76: Believers fight for the cause of Allah, whereas disbelievers fight for the cause of the Devil. So fight against Satan’s ˹evil˺ forces. Indeed, Satan’s schemes are ever weak. </li>

          <li>Quran 7-199: Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act ignorantly. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-7: ˹Remember, O  believers,˺ when Allah promised ˹to give˺ you the upper hand over either target, you wished to capture the unarmed party.1 But it was Allah’s Will to establish the truth by His Words and uproot the disbelievers; </li>
          <li>Quran 9-46: Had they ˹really˺ intended to march forth, they would have made preparations for it. But Allah disliked that they should go, so He let them lag behind, and it was said ˹to them˺, “Stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-65, 66: If you question them, they will certainly say, “We were only talking idly and joking around.” Say, “Was it Allah, His revelations, and His Messenger that you ridiculed?” Make no excuses! You have lost faith after your belief. If We pardon a group of you,1 We will punish others for their wickedness. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-83: If Allah returns you ˹O Prophet˺ to a group of them and they ask to go forth with you, say, “You will not ever go forth or fight an enemy along with me. You preferred to stay behind the first time, so stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-108: Do not ˹O Prophet˺ ever pray in it. Certainly, a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy of your prayers. In it are men who love to be purified.1 And Allah loves those who purify themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-29: O  my people! I do not ask you for a payment for this ˹message˺. My reward is only from Allah. And I will never dismiss the believers, for they will surely meet their Lord. But I can see that you are a people acting ignorantly. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-4, 5:˹Remember˺ when Joseph said to his father, “O my dear father! Indeed I dreamt of eleven stars, and the sun, and the moon—I saw them prostrating to me!”1 He replied, “O my dear son! Do not relate your vision to your brothers, or they will devise a plot against you. Surely Satan is a sworn enemy to humankind. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-67: He then instructed ˹them˺, “O my sons! Do not enter ˹the city˺ all through one gate, but through separate gates.1 I cannot help you against ˹what is destined by˺ Allah in the least. It is only Allah Who decides. In Him I put my trust. And in Him let the faithful put their trust.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-4: We have not sent a messenger except in the language of his people to clarify ˹the message˺ for them. Then Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-60: To those who disbelieve in the Hereafter belong all evil qualities, whereas to Allah belong the finest attributes. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise. </li>

          <li>Quran 18-28: And patiently stick with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure.1 Do not let your eyes look beyond them, desiring the luxuries of this worldly life. And do not obey those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow ˹only˺ their desires and whose state is ˹total˺ loss. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-58: Those were ˹some of˺ the prophets who Allah has blessed from among the descendants of Adam, and of those We carried with Noah ˹in the Ark˺, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel,1 and of those We ˹rightly˺ guided and chose. Whenever the revelations of the Most Compassionate were recited to them, they fell down, prostrating and weeping. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 14: Just as rain cannot penetrate a well-roofed house, so also, passion (raga) cannot
            penetrate a mind well-cultivated in Tranquillity and Insight Development (Samatha and Vipassana)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 22: Fully comprehending this, the wise, who are mindful, rejoice in being mindful and
            find delight in the domain of the Noble Ones (Ariyas)</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 28: The wise one dispels negligence by means of mindfulness; he ascends the tower of
            wisdom and being free from sorrow looks at the sorrowing beings. Just as one on the mountain top looks at
            those on the plain below, so also, the wise one (the arahat) looks at the foolish and the ignorant
            (worldlings).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 75: Indeed, the path that leads to worldly gain is one and the Path that leads to
            Nibbana is another. Fully comprehending this, the bhikkhu, the disciple of the Buddha, should not take
            delight in worldly gain and honour, but devote himself to solitude, detachment and the realization of
            Nibbana. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Lakundaka Bhaddiya: "An arahat never loses his temper, he has no desire to speak
            harshly or to think ill of others. He is like a mountain of solid rock; as a solid rock is unshaken, so
            also, an arahat is unperturbed by scorn or by praise."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 81: As a mountain of rock is unshaken by wind, so also, the wise are unperturbed by
            blame or by praise. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 83: Indeed, the virtuous give up all (i.e., attachment to the five khandhas, etc.); the
            virtuous (lit., the tranquil) do not talk with sensual desire; when faced with joy or sorrow, the wise do
            not show elation or depression. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 91: The mindful strive diligently (in the Tranquillity and Insight Development
            Practice); they take no delight in the home (i.e., in the life of sensual pleasures); like swans (hamsa)
            that forsake the muddy pool, they abandon all home life (i.e., all cravings). /li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 92: Arahats do not hoard (anything); when taking food they reflect well over it (i.e.,
            in accordance with the three parinnas).* They have as their object liberation from existence, that is,
            Nibbana which is Void and Signless. Their destination, like the course of birds in the air, cannot be
            traced. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 93: The arahat is free from moral intoxicants (asavas); he is not attached to food. He
            has as his object liberation from existence, i.e., Nibbana which is Void and Signless. His path, like that
            of birds in the air, cannot be traced. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 95: Like the earth, the arahat is patient and is not provoked to respond in anger; like
            the door-post he is firm; he is unperturbed by the ups and downs of life; he is serene and pure like a
            lake free from mud. For such an arahat there will be no more rebirth. </li>
          <li>The Story of a Samanera from Kosambi: The Buddha listened to him, and replied, "My son, an arahat does not
            get angry with anyone he is restrained in his senses and is perfectly calm and serene."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 171: Come, look at this world (i.e., the five khandhas), which is like an ornamented
            royal carriage. Fools flounder in this world of the khandhas, but the wise are not attached to it. </li>
          <li>The Story of the Question Raised by Thera Ananda: After reflecting thus, Thera Ananda went to the Buddha,
            and put to him the question of the noblest of men. To him the Buddha replied, "Ananda, the noblest of men is
            not born everywhere, he is born only among Khattiyamahasala and Brahmanamahasala, the wealthy clans of
            Khattiya and Brahmana."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 296: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night
            are always mindful of the qualities of the Buddha.
            Verse 297: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always
            mindful of the qualities of the Dhamma.
            Verse 298: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always
            mindful of the qualities of the Samgha.
            Verse 299: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, who by day and by night are always
            mindful of the component parts of the body.
            Verse 300: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, whose mind by day and by night
            always takes delight in being compassionate (lit., harmless).
            Verse 301: Fully alert and ever vigilant are Gotama Buddha's disciples, whose mind by day and by night
            always takes delight in the cultivation (of good-will towards all).
          </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 351: He who has attained arahatship is free from fear, free from craving, and free from
            moral defilements. He has cut off the thorns of existence (such as lust). This is the last existence (for
            him).
            Verse 352: He who is free from craving and from attachment, who is skilled in the knowledge of the
            significance of terms, who knows the grouping of letters and their sequence is indeed called "one who has
            lived his last, a man of great wisdom, a great man."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 363: The bhikkhu who controls his mouth (speech) who speaks wisely with his mind
            composed, who explains the meaning and the text of the Dhamma, — sweet are the words of that bhikkhu.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 378: The bhikkhu who is calm in body, calm in speech, and calm in mind, who is
            well-composed and has given up (lit., vomited) worldly pleasures, is called a "Tranquil One".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 385: Him I call a brahmana who has for him neither this shore (i.e., the sense-bases) nor
            the other shore (i.e., the sense objects), and who is undistressed and free from moral defilements1.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 386: Him I call a brahmana, who dwells in seclusion practising Tranquility and Insight
            Meditation and is free from taints (of moral defilements); who has performed his duties, and is free from
            moral intoxicants (asavas) and has reached the highest goal (arahatship).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 388: Because he has discarded evil he is called a 'brahmana'; because he lives calmly he
            is called a 'samana'; and because he gets rid of his impurities he is called a 'pabbajita'.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Back at the monastery, the bhikkhus told the Buddha how the Venerable
            Sariputta had patiently borne the scolding and abuses of his mother. To them, the Buddha said that arahats
            never get angry, they never lose their temper.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 400: Him I call a brahmana, who is free from anger, who practises austerity, who is
            virtuous and free from craving, who is controlled in his senses and for whom this body (i.e., existence) is
            the very last.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Uppalavanna*: In this connection, they asked the Buddha whether arahats do not enjoy
            sensual pleasures as they have the same physical make-up like any other people. To them the Buddha replied,
            "Bhikkhus! Arahats do not enjoy sensual pleasures; they do not indulge in sensual pleasures, for they do not
            cling to objects of sense and to sensual pleasures, just as water does not cling to the lotus leaf or the
            mustard seed to the tip of an awl."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 402: Him I call a brahmana, who even in this existence realizes the end of dukkha (i.e.,
            Nibbana), who has laid down the burden (of the khandhas) and who is free from moral defilements.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Khema*: Sakka asked the Buddha who that bhikkhuni was and the Buddha replied, "She is
            one of my pre-eminent disciples; she is known as Theri Khema. She is matchless amongst the bhikkhunis in
            wisdom and she knows how to differentiate the right way from the wrong way."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 407: Him I call a brahmana, from whom passion, ill will, pride and detraction have fallen
            off like a mustard seed from the tip of an awl.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 412: Him I call a brahmana, who, in this world, has transcended both ties good and evil;
            who is sorrowless and, being free from the taints of moral defilements, is pure.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 421: Him I call a brahmana, who does not cling to the past, future and present khandha

            When Ch'ih was proceeding to Chi'i, he had fat horses to his carriage, and wore light furs. I have heard

          <li>"Cautious and slow in his speech!" said Niu;-"is this what is meant by perfect virtue?" The Master said,
            "When a man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?" (C.A.
            quote
            460)</li>
          <li>Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, "The superior man has neither anxiety nor fear
            (C.A. quote 461)</li>
          <li>Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, "He with whom neither slander that
            gradually soaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may
            be
            called intelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling statements, are
            successful, may be called farseeing." (C.A. quote 467)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to
            perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of this." (C.A. quote 486)</li>
          <li>Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's
            words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be

          <li>The Master said, "The superior man is easy to serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in
            any way which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he uses
            them according to their capacity. The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you try to
            please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant with right, he may be pleased. But in his
            employment of men, he wishes to be equal to everything." (C.A. quote 554)</li>

          <li>Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "The cultivation of himself in
            reverential carefulness." "And is this all?" said Tzze-lu. "He cultivates himself so as to give rest to
            others," was the reply. "And is this all?" again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, "He cultivates himself so
            as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself so as to give rest to all the people:-even Yao

          <li>The Master said, "The superior man in everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs it
            according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity. This
            is
            indeed a superior man." (C.A. quote 659)</li>
          <li>The superior man is distressed by his want of ability. He is not distressed by men's not knowing him

          <li>The superior man does not promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put aside good words
            because of the man (C.A. quote 664)</li>
          <li>The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-even in that there is
            sometimes want. So with learning;-emolument may be found in it. The superior man in anxious lest he should
            not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him (C.A. quote 674)</li>
          <li>The superior man cannot be known in little matters; but he may be interested with great concerns. The

          <li>The superior man is correctly firm, and not firm merely (C.A. quote 681)</li>
          <li>Therefore a superior man consider it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and
            also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in
            his words there may be nothing incorrect (C.A. quote 517)</li>
          <li>The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct (C.A. quote 130)</li>

          <li>The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the
            rules
            of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right (C.A. quote 204)</li>
          <li>There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of
            Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of the sages (C.A. quote 710)</li>
          <li>The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to
            the
            use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear
            distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his
            demeanor,
            he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be
            sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that is should be reverently careful. In regard
            to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties
            his anger may involve him in. When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness. (C.A. quote 713)
          </li>
          <li>Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil! and shrinking
            from
            it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:-I have seen such men, as I have heard such
            words (C.A. quote 714)</li>
          <li>Tsze-kung said, "Has the superior man his hatreds also?" The Master said, "He has his hatreds. He hates
            those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who, being in a low station, slanders his
            superiors.
            He hates those who have valor merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He hates those who are forward and
            determined, and, at the same time, of contracted understanding." (C.A. quote 772)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "The superior man undergoes three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern;
            when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his language is firm and decided." (C.A. quote
            812)
          </li>
          <li>Superior men, and yet not always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has been a mean man,

          <li>He had four of the characteristics of a superior man-in his conduct of himself, he was humble; in
            serving
            his superior, he was respectful; in nourshing the people, he was kind; in ordering the people, he was just
            (C.A. quote 156)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia said, "Mechanics have their shops to dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The

            "Venerable Sir! Since you know that I have come from my house, I interpreted that, by your first question,
            you meant to ask me from what past existence I have come here. Hence my answer, 'I do not know.' The second
            question means, to what future existence I would be going from here; hence my answer, 'I do not know.' The
            third question means whether I do not know that I would die one day; hence my answer, 'yes, I do know.' The
            last question means whether I know when I would die; hence my answer, 'I do not know.

            The Buddha was satisfied with her explanation and he said to the audience, "Most of you might not understand
            clearly the meaning of the answers given by the young weaver. Those who are ignorant are in darkness, they
            are just like the blind."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 174: Blind are the people of this world: only a few in this world see clearly (with
            Insight). Just as only a few birds escape from the net, so also, only a few get to the world of the devas,
            (and Nibbana).</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 271 & 272: Not only by mere moral practice, nor by much learning, nor by acquiring
            concentration, nor by dwelling in seclusion, nor by assuring oneself, "I enjoy the bliss of Anagami Fruition
            that is not enjoyed by common worldlings (puthujjanas)," should the bhikkhu, rest content without attaining
            the extinction of moral intoxicants (asavas) [i.e., without attaining arahatship]. </li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: The Buddha came to them in the midst of their conversation and said to
            them, "Bhikkhus, the path you are talking about is external to you; a bhikkhu should only be concerned with
            the path of the Noble Ones (ariyas) and strive to do what should be done for the attainment of the Ariya
            Path (Magga) that leads to the realization of the Perfect Peace (Nibbana).</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Bhaddiya, the Short One: The Buddha called their attention to the short thera and said
            to them, "Bhikkhus, look at that thera. He has killed both his father and his mother, and having killed his
            parents he goes about without any dukkha."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Woman of Jealous Disposition: So the Buddha said, "Do no evil, thinking that people will
            not know about it. An evil deed done in secret, when discovered, will bring much pain and sorrow; but a good
            deed may be done secretly, for it can only bring happiness and not sorrow."</li>
          <li>The Story of Many Bhikkhus: On learning about the hardships they had undergone during the vassa, the
            Buddha said to them "Bhikkhus, do not keep thinking about this or anything else; it is always difficult to
            have a carefree, effortless living. Just as the townsfolk guard their town, so also, a bhikkhu should be on
            guard and keep his mind steadfastly on his body."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verses 345 & 346: The wise do not say that bonds made of iron, of wood, and of hemp are strong
            bonds; they say that only passionate attachment to and care for gems and jewelry, children and wives are
            strong bonds. These drag one down (to lower planes of existence) and although they seem yielding are
            difficult to unfasten. The wise, cutting off this bond (of craving) and resolutely giving up sensual
            pleasures, renounce the world.</li>
          <li>The story of Samenra Sumana: At the congregation of the bhikkhus in the evening, the bhikkhus told the
            Buddha about the wonderful trip made by Samanera Sumana. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, one who
            practises the Dhamma vigilantly and zealously is capable of attaining supernormal powers, even though he is
            young."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 392: If from somebody one should learn the Teaching of the Buddha, he should respectfully
            pay homage to that teacher, as a brahmin worships the sacrificial fire.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Abusive Brahmin Brothers: "What do we have to kill to be able to live happily and
            peacefully?" and his second question was, "Killing of what dhamma do you approve of?" To these questions,
            the Buddha replied, " O brahmin, to be able to live happily and peacefully, one will have to kill ill will
            (dosa). Killing one's ill will is liked and praised by the Buddhas and the arahats." </li>
          <li>The Story of Devahita the Brahmin: After drinking the mixture there was instant relief. The brahmin then
            came and asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! An offering made to whom gives one the greatest benefit?" To him
            the Buddha said, "Brahmin! An offering made to one who has given up all evil is the most beneficial."</li>

            Quran 2-26: Surely Allah does not shy away from using the parable of a mosquito or what is even smaller. As
            for the believers, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And as for the disbelievers, they argue,
            “What does Allah mean by such a parable?” Through this ˹test˺, He leaves many to stray, and guides many. And
            He leaves none to stray except the rebellious—
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-66: So We made their fate an example to present and future generations, and a lesson to the God-fearing. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-158: Indeed, the hills of Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever performs the pilgrimage or minor pilgrimage, let them walk between the two hills. And whoever does good willingly, Allah is truly Appreciative, All-knowing.</li>
          <li>Quran 2-257: Allah is the Guardian of the believers—He brings them out of darkness and into light. As for the disbelievers, their guardians are false gods who lead them out of light and into darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-13: Indeed, there was a sign for you in the two armies that met in battle—one fighting for the cause of Allah and the other in denial. The believers saw their enemy twice their number.1 But Allah supports with His victory whoever He wills. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-154: Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-166, 167: So what you suffered on the day the two armies met was by Allah’s Will, so that He might distinguish the ˹true˺ believers and expose the hypocrites. When it was said to them, “Come fight in the cause of Allah or ˹at least˺ defend yourselves,” they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief on that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. Allah is All-Knowing of what they hide.  </li>
          <li>Quran 3-175: That ˹warning˺ was only ˹from˺ Satan, trying to prompt you to fear his followers.1 So do not fear them; fear Me if you are ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-199: Indeed, there are some among the People of the Book who truly believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you ˹believers˺ and what was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah—never trading Allah’s revelations for a fleeting gain. Their reward is with their Lord. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-77: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who had been told, “Do not fight! Rather, establish prayer and pay alms-tax.”? Then once the order came to fight, a group of them feared those ˹hostile˺ people as Allah should be feared—or even more. They said, “Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to fight? If only You had delayed ˹the order for˺ us for a little while!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The enjoyment of this world is so little, whereas the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. And none of you will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-94: O believers! Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of your hands and spears to distinguish those who fear Him in secret. Whoever transgresses from now on will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-46: Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if Allah were to take away your hearing or sight, or seal your hearts—who else other than Allah could restore it?” See ˹O Prophet˺ how We vary the signs, yet they still turn away. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-65: Say, “He ˹alone˺ has the power to unleash upon you a torment from above or below you or split you into ˹conflicting˺ factions and make you taste the violence of one another.” See how We vary the signs, so perhaps they will comprehend. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-4: ˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed! Our torment took them by surprise ˹while sleeping˺ at night or midday. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-17: It was not you ˹believers˺ who killed them, but it was Allah Who did so. Nor was it you ˹O Prophet˺ who threw ˹a handful of sand at the disbelievers˺,1 but it was Allah Who did so, rendering the believers a great favour. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-23: Had Allah known any goodness in them, He would have certainly made them hear. ˹But˺ even if He had made them hear, they would have surely turned away heedlessly. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-97: The nomadic Arabs ˹around Medina˺ are far worse in disbelief and hypocrisy, and less likely to know the laws revealed by Allah to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-110: The building which they erected will never cease to fuel hypocrisy in their hearts until their hearts are torn apart. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. 
          <li>Quran 10-6: Surely in the alternation of the day and the night, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are truly signs for those mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-24: The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky, producing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then just as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they have full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, so We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-108: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “This is my way. I invite to Allah with insight—I and those who follow me. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-4: And on the earth there are ˹different˺ neighbouring tracts, gardens of grapevines, ˹various˺ crops, palm trees—some stemming from the same root, others standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-6: ˹Consider˺ when Moses said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favour upon you when He rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-24, 25, 26, 27: Do you not see how Allah compares a good word to a good tree? Its root is firm and its branches reach the sky, ˹always˺ yielding its fruit in every season by the Will of its Lord. This is how Allah sets forth parables for the people, so perhaps they will be mindful. And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree, uprooted from the earth, having no stability. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-56: He exclaimed, “Who would despair of the mercy of their Lord except the misguided?” </li>
          <li>Quran 15-85: We have not created the heavens and the earth and everything in between except for a purpose. And the Hour is certain to come, so forgive graciously. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-30: And ˹when˺ it is said to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, “What has your Lord revealed?” They say, “All the best!” For those who do good in this world, there is goodness. But far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter. How excellent indeed is the home of the righteous: </li>
          <li>Quran 16-65: And Allah sends down rain from the sky, giving life to the earth after its death. Surely in this is a sign for those who listen. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-70: Allah has created you, and then causes you to die. And some of you are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-79: Have they not seen the birds glide in the open sky? None holds them up except Allah. Surely in this are signs for those who believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-108: They are the ones whose hearts, ears, and eyes are sealed by Allah, and it is they who are ˹truly˺ heedless. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-45, 46, 47:  When you ˹O Prophet˺ recite the Quran, We put a hidden barrier between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter. We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran, they turn their backs in aversion. We know best how they listen to your recitation and what they say privately—when the wrongdoers say, “You would only be following a bewitched man.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-110: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Compassionate—whichever you call, He has the Most Beautiful Names.” Do not recite your prayers too loudly or silently, but seek a way between. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-57: And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-83, 84: Do you ˹O Prophet˺ not see that We have sent the devils against the disbelievers, constantly inciting them? So do not be in haste against them, for indeed We are ˹closely˺ counting down their days. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-88, 89, 90, 91: They1 say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring.” You have certainly made an outrageous claim, by which the heavens are about to burst, the earth to split apart, and the mountains to crumble to pieces in protest of attributing children to the Most Compassionate. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-90: Aaron had already warned them beforehand, “O my people! You are only being tested by this, for indeed your ˹one true˺ Lord is the Most Compassionate. So follow me and obey my orders.” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-125, 126, 127: They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, although I used to see?” Allah will respond, “It is so, just as Our revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are neglected.” This is how We reward whoever transgresses and does not believe in the revelations of their Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-44: In fact, We have allowed enjoyment for these ˹Meccans˺ and their forefathers for such a long time ˹that they took it for granted˺. Do they not see that We gradually reduce ˹their˺ land from its borders? Is it they who will then prevail? </li>
          <li>Quran 22-15: Whoever thinks that Allah will not help His Prophet in this world and the Hereafter, let them stretch out a rope to the ceiling and strangle themselves, then let them see if this plan will do away with ˹the cause of˺ their rage.1  </li>

He wondered, “How could Allah bring this back to life after its destruction?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then brought him back to life. Allah asked, “How long have you remained ˹in this state˺?” He replied, “Perhaps a day or part of a day.” Allah said, “No! You have remained here for a hundred years! Just look at your food and drink—they have not spoiled. ˹But now˺ look at ˹the remains of˺ your donkey! And ˹so˺ We have made you into a sign for humanity.

            time, Thera Ananda went in, but he did not find any of the bhikkhus. So, he asked the Buddha where all those
            bhikkhus had gone. The Buddha then replied, "Ananda, all those bhikkhus, after hearing my discourse, had
            attained arahatship, and with their supernormal powers, they let travelling through space."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 175: Swans travel in the sky; those with supernormal powers travel through space; the

          <li>The Story of Five Lay-disciples: Thera Ananda then asked the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! What are the things
            that prevent people from being able to take in the Dhamma?" And the Buddha replied, "Ananda, passion (raga),
            ill will (dosa) and ignorance (moha) are the three things that prevent people from taking in the Dhamma.
            Passion burns one; there is no fire like passion. The world may burn up when seven suns rise in the sky, but
            that happens very rarely. Passion burns always and without any break."</li>

            cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over.
            Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish to cut himself
            off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not know his own
            capacity. (C.A. quote 832)</li>

            Quran 2-189: They ask you O Prophet about the phases of the moon. Say, "They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage." Righteousness is not entering your houses from the back doors. Rather, righteousness is to be mindful of Allah. So enter your homes through their proper doors, and be mindful of Allah so you may be successful.
          </li>
          <li>Quran 2-258: Are you ˹O Prophet˺ not aware of the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord because Allah had granted him kingship? ˹Remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord is the One Who has power to give life and cause death.” He argued, “I too have the power to give life and cause death.” Abraham challenged ˹him˺, “Allah causes the sun to rise from the east. So make it rise from the west.” And so the disbeliever was dumbstruck. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-75, 76, 77, 78, 79: We also showed Abraham the wonders of the heavens and the earth, so he would be sure in faith. When the night grew dark upon him, he saw a star and said, “This is my Lord!” But when it set, he said, “I do not love things that set.” Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This one is my Lord!” But when it disappeared, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will certainly be one of the misguided people.” Then when he saw the sun shining, he said, “This must be my Lord—it is the greatest!” But again when it set, he declared, “O my people! I totally reject whatever you associate ˹with Allah in worship˺. I have turned my face towards the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth—being upright—and I am not one of the polytheists.”</li>
          <li>Quran 9-36: Indeed, the number of months ordained by Allah is twelve—in Allah’s Record1 since the day He created the heavens and the earth—of which four are sacred. That is the Right Way. So do not wrong one another during these months. And together fight the polytheists as they fight against you together. And know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-37: Reallocating the sanctity of ˹these˺ months1 is an increase in disbelief, by which the disbelievers are led ˹far˺ astray. They adjust the sanctity one year and uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified by Allah, violating the very months Allah has made sacred. Their evil deeds have been made appealing to them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-5: He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and the moon a reflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so that you may know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. Allah did not create all this except for a purpose. He makes the signs clear for people of knowledge. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-2: It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars—as you can see—then established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair. He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. 
          <li>Quran 13-3: And He is the One Who spread out the earth and placed firm mountains and rivers upon it, and created fruits of every kind in pairs.1 He covers the day with night. Surely in this are signs for those who reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-33: He has ˹also˺ subjected for you the sun and the moon, both constantly orbiting, and has subjected the day and night for you.</li>
          <li>Quran 14-48, 49, 50: ˹Watch for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the earth will be changed into a different earth and the heavens as well, and all will appear before Allah—the One, the Supreme. On that Day you will see the wicked bound together in chains, with garments of tar, and their faces covered with flames. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-16, 17, 18: Indeed, We have placed constellations in the sky, and adorned it for all to see.  And We protected it from every accursed devil, except the one eavesdropping, who is then pursued by a visible flare.1 </li>
          <li>Quran 16-12: And He has subjected for your benefit the day and the night, the sun and the moon. And the stars have been subjected by His command. Surely in this are signs for those who understand. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-48: Have they not considered how the shadows of everything Allah has created incline to the right and the left ˹as the sun moves˺, totally submitting to Allah in all humility? </li>
          <li>Quran 17-44: The seven heavens, the earth, and all those in them glorify Him. There is not a single thing that does not glorify His praises—but you ˹simply˺ cannot comprehend their glorification. He is indeed Most Forbearing, All-Forgiving. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-30: Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were ˹once˺ one mass then We split them apart?1 And We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? </li>
          <li>Quran 21-33:  And He is the One Who created the day and the night, the sun and the moon—each travelling in an orbit. </li>

      <h4>The prophets on angels</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>The Story of Thera Anuruddha: To those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus, do not think my son
            Anuruddha has asked his relatives and lay disciples to send rice gruel and other foods. My son the thera
            did not ask for anything; arahats do not talk about such things like food and clothing. The excessive
            amount of food brought to the monastery this morning was due to the promptings of a celestial being and
            not of a man."</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Mahakaccayana: The bhikkhus were awed by Sakka paying obeisance to Mahakaccayana, but
            some bhikkhus thought that Sakka was being partial to Mahakaccayana. To them, the Buddha said, "One who is
            restrained in his senses is loved by both men and devas.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 94: The arahat whose sense-faculties are calm like horses well-tamed by the charioteer,
            who is free from pride and moral intoxicants - such an arahat is held dear even by the devas. </li>
          <li>The Story of Cincamanavika: At that instant, Sakka, king of the devas, became aware of the trouble being
            brewed at the Jetavana monastery, so he sent four of his devas in the form of young rats. The four rats got
            under the clothes of Cincamanavika and bit off the strings that fastened the wooden plank round her stomach.
            As the strings broke, the wooden plank dropped, cutting off the front part of her feet. Thus, the deception
            of Cincamanavika was uncovered, and many from the crowd cried out in anger, "Oh you wicked woman! A liar and
            a cheat! How dare you accuse our noble Teacher!" Some of them spat on her and drove her out. She ran as fast
            as she could, and when she had gone some distance the earth cracked and fissured and she was swallowed up.

            The next day, while the bhikkhus were talking about Cincamanavika, the Buddha came to them and said.
            "Bhikkhu;, one who is not afraid to tell lies, and who does not care what happens in the future existence,
            will not hesitate to do any evil."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 181: The wise who practise jhana concentration and Insight Meditation take delight in the
            peace of liberation from sensual pleasures and moral defilements. Such wise and mindful ones, who truly
            comprehend the Four Noble Truths (i.e., Arahats and Buddhas) are held dear also by the devas. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 200: Indeed we live very happily, without any anxiety (i.e., without greed, ill will and
            ignorance); like the Abhassara brahmas we shall live on delightful satisfaction (piti) as our food.</li>
          <li>The Story of Sakka: The bhikkhus were surprised and awe-struck to find Sakka himself attending on the
            Buddha. When the Buddha heard their remarks he said, "Bhikkhus! There is nothing surprising about Sakka's
            love and devotion to me. Once, when the former Sakka was growing old and was about to pass away, he came to
            see me. Then, I expounded the Dhamma to him. While listening to the Dhamma, he attained Sotapatti Fruition;
            then he passed away and was reborn as the present Sakka. All these happened to him simply because he
            listened to the Dhamma expounded by me. Indeed, bhikkhus, it is good to see the Noble Ones (ariyas); it is a
            pleasure to live with them; to live with fools is, indeed, painful."</li>
          <li>The Story of Licchavi Princes: On one festival day, the Buddha entered the town of Vesali, accompanied by
            a retinue of bhikkhus. On their way, they met some Licchavi princes, who had come out elegantly dressed up.
            The Buddha seeing them in full regalia said to the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus, those who have not been to the
            Tavatimsa deva world should have a good look at these Licchavi princes." The princes were then on their way
            to a pleasure garden. There, they quarrelled over a prostitute and soon came to blows. As a result, some of
            them had to be carried home, bleeding. As the Buddha returned with the bhikkhus after his meal in the town,
            they saw the wounded princes being carried home.
            In connection with the above incident the bhikkhus remarked, "For the sake of a woman, these Licchavi
            princes are ruined." To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus, sorrow and fear arise out of enjoyment of
            sensual pleasures and attachment to them."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Boys: Later, when the bhikkhus remarked that the boys were very partial to Thera
            Kassapa, the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus, all bhikkhus who are like my son Kassapa are liked by both
            devas and men. Such bhikkhus always receive ample offerings of the four requisites of bhikkhus."</li>
          <li>The Story of Kisagotami: Sakka seeing her, asked the Buddha who the lady was, and the Buddha replied, "O
            Sakka! She is my daughter Kisagotami. Once, she came to me in sorrow and distress through the loss of her
            son and I made her see the impermanent, the unsatisfactory and the non-self nature of all conditioned
            things. As a consequence of that she attained Sotapatti Fruition, joined the Order, and became an arahat.
            She is one of my eminent female disciples and is matchless in the ascetic practice of wearing robes made
            from rags collected from a dust heap."</li>

          <li>Quran 2-30: ˹Remember˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive ˹human˺
            authority on earth.” They asked ˹Allah˺, “Will You place in it someone who will spread corruption there and
            shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do
            not know.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 2-34: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,”1 so they all did—but not Iblîs,2 who refused and acted arrogantly,3 becoming unfaithful. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-102: They ˹instead˺ followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon. Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils disbelieved. They taught magic to the people, along with what had been revealed to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, in Babylon.1 The two angels never taught anyone without saying, “We are only a test ˹for you˺, so do not abandon ˹your˺ faith.” Yet people learned ˹magic˺ that caused a rift ˹even˺ between husband and wife; although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah’s Will. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed was the price for which they sold their souls, if only they knew! </li>
          <li>Quran 2-248: Their prophet further told them, “The sign of Saul’s kingship is that the Ark will come to you—containing reassurance1 from your Lord and relics of the family of Moses and the family of Aaron,2 which will be carried by the angels. Surely in this is a sign for you, if you ˹truly˺ believe.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-80: And he would never ask you to take angels and prophets as lords. Would he ask you to disbelieve after you have submitted? </li>
          <li>Quran 3-124, 125: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when you said to the believers, “Is it not enough that your Lord will send down a reinforcement of three thousand angels for your aid?” Most certainly, if you ˹believers˺ are firm and mindful ˹of Allah˺ and the enemy launches a sudden attack on you, Allah will reinforce you with five thousand angels designated ˹for battle˺.  </li>
          <li>Quran 6-61: He reigns supreme over all of His creation, and sends recording-angels, watching over you. When death comes to any of you, Our angels take their soul, never neglecting this duty. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-93: Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or claims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to them—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of Allah’s revelations!”? If you ˹O Prophet˺ could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands ˹saying˺, “Give up your souls! Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for telling lies about Allah and for being arrogant towards His revelations!” </li>
          <li>Quran 6-111: Even if We had sent them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and assembled before their own eyes every sign ˹they demanded˺, they still would not have believed—unless Allah so willed. But most of them are ignorant ˹of this˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-158: Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or some of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive, belief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no good through their faith.1 Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-27: O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your parents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to expose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who disbelieve. </li>
          <li>Qruan 7-206: Surely those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate. </li>
          <li>Quran 8-9: ˹Remember˺ when you cried out to your Lord for help, He answered, “I will reinforce you with a thousand angels—followed by many others.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 8-12: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when your Lord revealed to the angels, “I am with you. So make the believers stand firm. I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-50: If only you could see when the angels take the souls of the disbelievers, beating their faces and backs, ˹saying,˺ “Taste the torment of burning! </li>
          <li>Quran 9-26: Then Allah sent down His reassurance1 upon His Messenger and the believers, and sent down forces2 you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such was the reward of the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-70: And when he saw that their hands did not reach for the food, he became suspicious and fearful of them.1 They reassured ˹him˺, “Do not be afraid! We are ˹angels˺ sent ˹only˺ against the people of Lot.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-81, 82, 83: The angels said, “O Lot! We are the messengers of your Lord. They will never reach you. So travel with your family in the dark of night, and do not let any of you look back, except your wife. She will certainly suffer the fate of the others.1 Their appointed time is the morning. Is the morning not near?”  When Our command came, We turned the cities upside down and rained down on them clustered stones of baked clay, marked by your Lord ˹O Prophet˺. And these stones are not far from the ˹pagan˺ wrongdoers!</li>
          <li>Quran 11-94, 95: When Our command came, We saved Shu’aib and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook the wrongdoers, so they fell lifeless in their homes, as if they had never lived there. So away with Midian as it was with Thamûd! </li>
          <li>Quran 13-11: For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by Allah’s command. Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺. And if it is Allah’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him. 
          <li>Quran 13-13: The thunder glorifies His praises, as do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking with them whoever He wills. Yet they dispute about Allah. And He is tremendous in might. </li>
          <li>Quran 15-28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44: ˹Remember, O  Prophet˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to create a human being from sounding clay moulded from black mud.1 So when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own ˹creation˺ breathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.” So the angels prostrated all together—  but not Iblîs,1 who refused to prostrate with the others. Allah asked, “O Iblîs! What is the matter with you that you did not join others in prostration?” He replied, “It is not for me to prostrate to a human You created from sounding clay moulded from black mud.” Allah commanded, “Then get out of Paradise, for you are truly cursed. And surely upon you is condemnation until the Day of Judgment.” Satan appealed, “My Lord! Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.” Allah said, “You will be delayed until the appointed Day.” Satan responded, “My Lord! For allowing me to stray I will surely tempt them on earth and mislead them all together, except Your chosen servants among them.”  Allah said, “This is the Way, binding on Me: you will certainly have no authority over My servants, except the deviant who follow you, and surely Hell is their destined place, all together. It has seven gates, to each a group of them is designated.” </li> 
          <li>Quran 16-2: He sends down the angels with revelation by His command to whoever He wills of His servants, ˹stating:˺ “Warn ˹humanity˺ that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me, so be mindful of Me ˹alone˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-28: Those whose souls the angels seize while they wrong themselves will then offer ˹full˺ submission ˹and say falsely,˺ “We did not do any evil.” ˹The angels will say,˺ “No! Surely Allah fully knows what you used to do. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-32: those whose souls the angels take while they are virtuous, saying ˹to them˺, “Peace be upon you! Enter Paradise for what you used to do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 17-61: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,1 who protested, “Should I prostrate to the one You have created from mud?”
          <li>Quran 19-16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21: And mention in the Book ˹O Prophet, the story of˺ Mary when she withdrew from her family to a place in the east, screening herself off from them. Then We sent to her Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺ appearing before her as a man, perfectly formed. She appealed, “I truly seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you! ˹So leave me alone˺ if you are God-fearing.” He responded, “I am only a messenger from your Lord, ˹sent˺ to bless you with a pure son.” She wondered, “How can I have a son when no man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?” He replied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me. And so will We make him a sign for humanity and a mercy from Us.’ It is a matter ˹already˺ decreed.” </li>
          <li>Quran 19-22, 23, 24, 25, 26: So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place.  Then the pains of labour drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She cried, “Alas! I wish I had died before this, and was a thing long forgotten!” So a voice1 reassured her from below her, “Do not grieve! Your Lord has provided a stream at your feet. And shake the trunk of this palm tree towards you, it will drop fresh, ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink, and put your heart at ease. But if you see any of the people, say, ‘I have vowed silence1 to the Most Compassionate, so I am not talking to anyone today.’” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-26, 27, 28: And they say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring!”1 Glory be to Him! In fact, those ˹angels˺ are only ˹His˺ honoured servants,  who do not speak until He has spoken, ˹only˺ acting at His command. He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them. They do not intercede except for whom He approves, and they tremble in awe of Him. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-91: And ˹remember˺ the one who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her through Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺1 making her and her son a sign for all peoples. </li>

          <li>Quran 4-102: When you ˹O Prophet˺ are ˹campaigning˺ with them and you lead them in prayer, let one group of them pray with you—while armed. When they prostrate themselves, let the other group stand guard behind them. Then the group that has not yet prayed will then join you in prayer—and let them be vigilant and armed.1 The disbelievers would wish to see you neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch a sweeping assault on you. But there is no blame if you lay aside your weapons when overcome by heavy rain or illness—but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-189: He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-80: ˹It does not matter˺ whether you ˹O Prophet˺ pray for them to be forgiven or not. Even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will never forgive them. That is because they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the rebellious people. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-61: And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. He ˹is the One Who˺ produced you from the earth and settled you on it. So seek His forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. Surely my Lord is Ever Near, All-Responsive ˹to prayers˺.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-40, 41, 42, 43: My Lord! Make me and those ˹believers˺ of my descendants keep up prayer. Our Lord! Accept my prayers. Our Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and the believers on the Day when the judgment will come to pass.” Do not think ˹O Prophet˺ that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them until a Day when ˹their˺ eyes will stare in horror—  rushing forth, heads raised, never blinking, hearts void. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-78, 79, 80, 81: Observe the prayer from the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and the dawn prayer, for certainly the dawn prayer is witnessed ˹by angels˺.1  And rise at ˹the last˺ part of the night, offering additional prayers, so your Lord may raise you to a station of praise.1 And say, “My Lord! Grant me an honourable entrance and an honourable exit1 and give me a supporting authority from Yourself.” And declare, “The truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood is bound to vanish.” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36: Moses prayed, “My Lord! Uplift my heart for me, and make my task easy, and remove the impediment from my tongue so people may understand my speech,1 and grant me a helper from my family,  Aaron, my brother. Strengthen me through him,  and let him share my task,  so that we may glorify You much  and remember You much,  for truly You have ˹always˺ been overseeing us.”  Allah responded, “All that you requested has been granted, O  Moses! </li>

They will be presented before your Lord in rows, ˹and the deniers will be told,˺ “You have surely returned to Us ˹all alone˺ as We created you the first time, although you ˹always˺ claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.” And the record ˹of deeds˺ will be laid ˹open˺, and you will see the wicked in fear of what is ˹written˺ in it.

All voices will be hushed before the Most Compassionate. Only whispers1 will be heard. On that Day no intercession will be of any benefit, except by those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are agreeable to Him.  He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them,1 but they cannot encompass Him in ˹their˺ knowledge.2  And all faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining.

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 153: I, who have been seeking the builder of this house (body), failing to attain
            Enlightenment (Bodhi nana or Sabbannuta nana) which would enable me to find him, have wandered through
            innumerable births in samsara. To be born again and again is, indeed, dukkha!

            Verse 154: Oh house-builder! You are seen, you shall build no house (for me) again. All your rafters are
            broken, your roof-tree is destroyed. My mind has reached the unconditioned (i.e., Nibbana); the end of
            craving (Arahatta Phala) has been attained.</li>
          <li>The Story of the Three Daughters of Mara: The Buddha did not accept nor did he refuse the offer, but
            first, he related to the brahmin how the daughters of Mara tempted him soon after his attainment of
            Buddhahood. To the beautiful Tanha, Arati and Raga, the daughters of Mara, the Buddha had said, "It is no
            use tempting one who is free from craving, clinging and passion, for he cannot be lured by any temptation
            whatsoever."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Buddha's Return from the Tavatimsa Deva World: As promised, the Buddha came with the six
            coloured rays shining forth from his body to the city-gate of Sankassanagara, on the night of the full moon
            day of the month of Assayuja when the moon was shining brightly. He was accompanied by a large following of
            devas on one side and a large following of brahmas on the other. A large gathering headed by Thera Sariputta
            welcomed the Buddha back to this world; and the whole town was lit up. Thera Sariputta was awed by the
            grandeur and glory of the whole scene of the Buddha's return. He respectfully approached the Buddha and
            said, "Venerable Sir! We have never seen or even heard of such magnificent and resplendent glory. Indeed,
            Venerable Sir, you are loved, respected and revered alike by devas, brahmas and men!" To him the Buddha
            said, "My son Sariputta, the Buddhas who are endowed with unique qualities are truly loved by men and devas
            alike</li>
          <li>The Story of the Buddha's Former Deeds: On learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said to them,
            "Bhikkhus, that I have been revered so much by brahmas, devas and human beings alike and that they have made
            offerings on such a grand and lavish scale to me on this occasion is not due to the power I now possess; it
            is simply because I had done some small meritorious deeds in one of my previous existences that I now enjoy
            such great benefits".</li>
          <li>The Story of Upaka: When Upaka saw Gotama Buddha, he was very much impressed by the radiant countenance of
            the Buddha and so said to him, "Friend, you look so serene and pure; may I know who your teacher is?" To
            him, the Buddha replied that he had no teacher.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Ananda: Seeing the Buddha in his glory and splendour, the Venerable Ananda immediately
            approached the Buddha and burst forth, "O Venerable Sir! The light that shines forth from your noble body
            far surpasses the light from the king, the light from the thera, the light from the sun and the light from
            the moon."</li>

            A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, "May we not say that you Master is a sage? How various is his
            ability!" (C.A quote 302) Tsze-kung said, "Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a
            sage.

          <li>The Master said, "If there were any of the princes who would employ me, in the course of twelve months,
            I
            should have done something considerable. In three years, the government would be perfected." (C.A. quote
            528)</li>
          <li>Ch'an Tsze-ch'in, addressing Tsze-kung, said, "You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be
            superior
            to you?" (C.A. quote 833) Tsze-kung said to him, "For one word a man is often deemed to be wise, and for
            one
            word he is often deemed to be foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say. (C.A. quote 834) Our
            Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up by the steps of a
            stair." (C.A. quote 835)</li>
          <li>Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a state or the chief of a family, we should find
            verified
            the description which has been given of a sage's rule:-he would plant the people, and forthwith they would
            be established; he would lead them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make them happy, and
            forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would be
            harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it
            possible for him to be attained to?" (C.A. quote 836)</li>
          <li>Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-kung, who said, "Let me use the comparison of a house
            and its encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One may peep over it, and see whatever
            is
            valuable in the apartments. (C.A. quote 829)
            The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see
            the ancestral temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array. (C.A. quote 830) But I
            may
            assume that they are few who find the door. Was not the observation of the chief only what might have been
            expected?" (C.A. quote 831)</li>

And put your hand under your armpit, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished,1 as another sign,  so that We may show you some of Our greatest signs.

            prince sent him a gift of a living animal, he would keep it alive (C.A. quote 380)</li>
          <li>When he was in attendance on the prince and joining in the entertainment, the prince only sacrificed. He
            first tasted everything (C.A. quote 381)</li>
          <li>When he was ill and the prince came to visit him, he had his head to the east, made his court robes be

          <li>When a friend sent him a present, though it might be a carriage and horses, he did not bow (C.A. quote

          <li>The only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice (C.A. quote 387)</li>

            he
            would salute him in a ceremonious manner (C.A. quote 389)</li>
          <li>To any person in mourning he bowed forward to the crossbar of his carriage; he bowed in the same way to
            any one bearing the tables of population (C.A. quote 390)</li>
          <li>When he was at an entertainment where there was an abundance of provisins set before him, he would
            change
            countenance and rise up (C.A. quote 391)</li>
          <li>On a sudden clap of thunder, or a violent wind, he would change countenance (C.A. quote 392)</li>
          <li>When he was about to mount his carriage, he would stand straight, holding the cord (C.A. quote 393)</li>
          <li>When he was in the carriage, he did not turn his head quite round, he did not talk hastily, he did not
            point with his hands (C.A. quote 394)</li>
          <li>When Yen Yuan died, the Master bewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said,
            "Master, your grief is excessive!" (C.A. quote 408) "Is it excessive?" said he. "If I am not to mourn
            bitterly for this man, for whom should I mourn?" (C.A. quote 409)</li>
          <li>There were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no

          <li>He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was

          <li>Though there might be a large quantity of meat, he would not allow what he took to exceed the due

          <li>Quran 5-1: O believers! Honour your obligations. All grazing livestock has been made lawful to you—except what is hereby announced to you and hunting while on pilgrimage. Indeed, Allah commands what He wills. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-96: It is lawful for you to hunt and eat seafood, as a provision for you and for travellers. But hunting on land is forbidden to you while on pilgrimage. Be mindful of Allah to Whom you all will be gathered. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-119: Why should you not eat of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name when He has already explained to you what He has forbidden to you—except when compelled by necessity? Many ˹deviants˺ certainly mislead others by their whims out of ignorance. Surely your Lord knows the transgressors best. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-121: Do not eat of what is not slaughtered in Allah’s Name. For that would certainly be ˹an act of˺ disobedience. Surely the devils whisper to their ˹human˺ associates to argue with you.1 If you were to obey them, then you ˹too˺ would be polytheists. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-145: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to eat except carrion, running blood, swine—which is impure—or a sinful offering in the name of any other than Allah.

            her husband so that he would not see the Buddha; when she quietly stepped backwards and slowly came to where
            the Buddha was standing, and whispered to him, "Venerable Sir! We do not have any alms-food for you today."
            But the Buddha had decided not to leave the house; he just shook his head. Seeing this gesture, the

          <li>Quran 2-260: And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord! Show me how you give life to the dead.” Allah responded, “Do you not believe?” Abraham replied, “Yes I do, but just so my heart can be reassured.” Allah said, “Then bring four birds, train them to come to you, ˹then cut them into pieces,˺ and scatter them on different hilltops. Then call them back, they will fly to you in haste. And ˹so you will˺ know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-143: When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-40: ˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion,1 “Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-31: When she heard about their gossip,1 she invited them and set a banquet for them. She gave each one a knife, then said ˹to Joseph˺, “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they were so stunned ˹by his beauty˺ that they cut their hands,2 and exclaimed, “Good God! This cannot be human; this must be a noble angel!” </li>
          <li>Quran 19-10, 11: Zachariah said, “My Lord! Grant me a sign.” He responded, “Your sign is that you will not ˹be able to˺ speak to people for three nights, despite being healthy.” So he came out to his people from the sanctuary, signalling to them to glorify ˹Allah˺ morning and evening. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47: And surely We had shown You favour before, when We inspired your mother with this: ‘Put him into a chest, then put it into the river. The river will wash it ashore, and he will be taken by ˹Pharaoh,˺ an enemy of Mine and his.’ And I blessed you with lovability from Me1 ˹O Moses˺ so that you would be brought up under My ˹watchful˺ Eye. ˹Remember˺ when your sister came along and proposed, ‘Shall I direct you to someone who will nurse him?’1 So We reunited you with your mother so that her heart would be put at ease, and she would not grieve. ˹Later˺ you killed a man ˹by mistake˺, but We saved you from sorrow, as well as other tests We put you through. Then you stayed for a number of years among the people of Midian. Then you came here as pre-destined, O  Moses! And I have selected you for My service.  Go forth, you and your brother, with My signs and never falter in remembering Me. Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺.  Speak to him gently, so perhaps he may be mindful ˹of Me˺ or fearful ˹of My punishment˺.”  They both pleaded, “Our Lord! We fear that he may be quick to harm us or act tyrannically.”  Allah reassured ˹them˺, “Have no fear! I am with you, hearing and seeing.  So go to him and say, ‘Indeed we are both messengers from your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And salvation will be for whoever follows the ˹right˺ guidance. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76: They said, “O Moses! Either you cast, or let us be the first to cast.” Moses responded, “No, you go first.” And suddenly their ropes and staffs appeared to him—by their magic—to be slithering. So Moses concealed fear within himself. We reassured ˹him˺, “Do not fear! It is certainly you who will prevail. Cast what is in your right hand, and it will swallow up what they have made, for what they have made is no more than a magic trick. And magicians can never succeed wherever they go.” So the magicians fell down in prostration, declaring, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.” Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. You will really see whose punishment is more severe and more lasting.” They responded, “By the One Who created us! We will never prefer you over the clear proofs that have come to us. So do whatever you want! Your authority only covers the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world. Indeed, we have believed in our Lord so He may forgive our sins and that magic you have forced us to practice. And Allah is far superior ˹in reward˺ and more lasting ˹in punishment˺ Whoever comes to their Lord as an evildoer will certainly have Hell, where they can neither live nor die. But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done good, they will have the highest ranks: the Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, where they will stay forever. That is the reward of those who purify themselves. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 77: The man of wisdom should admonish others; he should give advice and should prevent

          <li>The Story of Dhamma Listeners: "Most people are attached to this world; only a very few reach the other
            shore (Nibbana)."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 99: Forests are delightful, but the worldlings find no delight in them; only those who
            are free from passion will find delight in them, for they do not seek sensual pleasures. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 116: One should make haste in doing good deeds; one should restrain one's mind from evil;
            for the mind of one who is slow in doing good tends to take delight in doing evil. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 133: Do not speak harshly to anyone; those who are thus spoken to will retort. Malicious
            talk is indeed the cause of trouble (dukkha) and retribution will come to you.
          <li>The Story of Schism in the Order: On hearing this, the Buddha reflected, "Devadatta is committing a very
            serious offence; it will send him to Avici Niraya. For a virtuous person, it is easy to do good deeds and
            difficult to do evil; but for an evil one, it is easy to do evil and difficult to do good deeds. Indeed, in
            life it is easy to do something which is not beneficial, but it is very difficult to do something which is
            good and beneficial."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 163: It is easy to do things that are bad and unbeneficial to oneself, but it is, indeed,
            most difficult to do things that are beneficial and good. /li>
          <li>The Story of the Defeat of the King of Kosala: The King of Kosala was ashamed and very much depressed over
            his defeat. Thus his lamentation: "What a disgrace! I cannot even conquer this boy who still smells of
            mother's milk. It is better that I should die." Feeling depressed and very much ashamed, the king refused to
            take food, and kept to his bed. The news about the king's distress spread like wild fire and when the Buddha
            came to learn about it, he said, "Bhikkhus! In one who conquers, enmity and hatred increase; one who is
            defeated suffers pain and distress."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 209: He who does what should not be done and fails to do what should be done, who
            forsakes the noble aim of life (i. e., Morality, Concentration and Insight) and grasps at sensual pleasure,
            covets the benefits gained by those who exert themselves (in meditation).
            Verse 210: Do not associate with those who are dear, and never with those who are not dear to you; not
            seeing the dear ones is painful, and seeing those who are not dear to you is also painful.
            Verse 211: Therefore, one should hold nothing dear; separation from the loved ones is painful; there are no
            fetters for those who do not love or hate.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 249: People give according to their faith and their devotion; one who is displeased with
            others receiving food and drink cannot attain concentration (samadhi) by day or by night.

            brought and threw away the bottles. Visakha requested the Buddha to teach them the Dhamma. By that time, the
            women were getting intoxicated and felt like singing and dancing. Mara, taking this opportunity made them
            bold and shameless, and soon they were boisterously singing, dancing, clapping and jumping about in the
            monastery. The Buddha saw the hand of Mara in the shameless behaviour of these women and said to himself,
            "Mara must not be given the opportunity." So, the Buddha sent forth dark-blue rays from his body and the
            whole room was darkened; the women were frightened and began to get sober. Then, the Buddha vanished from
            his seat and stood on top of Mount Meru, and from there he sent forth white rays and the sky was lit up as
            if by a thousand moons. After thus manifesting his powers, the Buddha said to those five hundred women, "You
            ladies should not have come to my monastery in this unmindful state. Because you have been negligent Mara
            has had the opportunity to make you behave shamelessly, laughing and singing loudly, in my monastery. Now,
            strive to put out the fire of passion (raga) which is in you".</li>

            false pride and undue elation when addressed as arahats, you are not guilty of breaking any of the rules of
            discipline of the bhikkhus. The fact is that the brahmin addressed you so because he was extremely devoted

          <li>Quran 3-78: There are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues to make you think this ˹distortion˺ is from the Book—but it is not what the Book says. They say, “It is from Allah”—but it is not from Allah. And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly. </li>

And Allah has perfect knowledge of those who are mindful ˹of Him˺. No one would ask for exemption except those who have no faith in Allah or the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so they are torn by their doubts. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada: Verse 119: Even an evil person may still find happiness so long as his evil deed does not bear
            fruit; but when his evil deed does bear fruit he will meet with evil consequences.
            Verse 120: Even a good person may still meet with suffering so long as his good deed does not bear fruit:
            but when it does bear fruit he will enjoy the benefits of his good deed.</li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Maha Moggallana: The bhikkhus felt very sorrowful over the death of Thera Maha
            Moggallana, and could not understand why such a personage like Thera Maha Moggallana should die at the hands
            of assassins. To them the Buddha said, "Bhikkhus! Considering that Moggallana had lived a noble life in this
            existence, he should not have met with such a death. But in one of his past existences, he had done a great
            wrong to his own parents, who were both blind. In the beginning, he was a very dutiful son, but after his
            marriage, his wife began to make trouble and she suggested that he should get rid of his parents. He took
            his blind parents in a cart into a forest, and there he killed them by beating them and making them believe
            that it was some thief who was beating them. For that evil deed he suffered in niraya for a long time; and
            in this existence, his last, he has died at the hands of assassins. Indeed, by doing wrong to those who
            should not be wronged, one is sure to suffer for it."</li>
          <li>The Story of Mahakala Upasaka: On their return to the monastery, they reported what they had seen and said
            to the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! The lay disciple who was at this monastery listening to the religious
            discourses all through the night has met with a death which he does not deserve." To them the Buddha
            replied, "Bhikkhus! If you judge from the good deeds he has done in this existence, he has indeed met with a
            death he does not deserve. But the fact is that he has only paid for the evil he had done in a past
            existence. In one of his previous existences, when he was a courtier in the palace of the king, he fell in
            love with another man's wife and had beaten her husband to death. Thus, evil deeds surely get one into
            trouble; they even lead one to the four apayas."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Brahmin: The Buddha went to the house of the brahmin and the brahmin talked to him about
            the great disaster that had befallen him. In reply, the Buddha said, "Brahmin, you do not know the cause of
            sorrow, but I know. If sorrow and fear arise, they arise because of craving."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Young Sow: When asked by the Venerable Ananda, the Buddha replied, "Ananda, this young sow
            was a hen during the time of Kakusandha Buddha. As she was then staying near a refectory in a monastery she
            used to hear the recitation of the sacred text and the discourses on the Dhamma. When she died she was
            reborn as a princess. On one occasion, while going to the latrine, the princess noticed the maggots and she
            became mindful of the loathsomeness of the body, etc. When she died she was reborn in the Brahma realm as a
            puthujjana brahma but later due to some evil kamma, she was reborn as a sow. Ananda! Look, on account of
            good and evil kamma there is no end of the round of existences."</li>

          <li>The Story of Aggidatta: The Buddha then asked Aggidatta what he taught his followers and the residents of
            the neighbourhood. Aggidatta replied that he had taught them to pay homage to mountains, forests, parks and
            gardens, and trees, and that by doing so, they would be liberated from all ills of life. The Buddha's reply
            to Aggidatta was, "Aggidatta, people go to mountains, forests, gardens and parks, and trees for refuge when
            they are threatened with danger, but these things cannot offer them any protection. Only those who take
            refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha are liberated from the round of rebirths (samsara)".</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 188: When threatened with danger, men go to many a refuge, - to mountains and forests, to
            parks and gardens, and to sacred trees.
            Verse 189: But such a refuge is not a safe refuge, not the best refuge. One is not liberated from all evil
            consequences of existence (dukkha) for having come to such a refuge.
            Verses 190 & 191: One, who takes refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha, sees with Magga Insight
            the Four Noble Truths, viz., Dukkha, the Cause of Dukkha, the Cessation of Dukkha, and the Noble Path of
            Eight Constituents which leads to the Cessation of Dukkha.

            liberated from all dukkha.</li>

            Verse 317: Those beings who see danger in what is not dangerous, who do not see danger in what is dangerous,

          <li>The Story of Thera Sariputta: Other bhikkhus who were staying with him at the Jetavana monastery
            misinterpreted his actions and said to the Buddha, "Venerable Sir! The Venerable Sariputta still worships
            the various directions, viz., the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir and the Zenith, as he has
            done before as a brahmin youth; it seems as if he has not yet given up his old beliefs." The Buddha sent for
            the Venerable Sariputta and Sariputta explained to the Buddha that he was only paying obeisance to his
            teacher, the Venerable Assaji, and that he was not worshipping the various directions. </li>

          <li>Quran 12-40: Whatever ˹idols˺ you worship instead of Him are mere names which you and your forefathers have made up1—a practice Allah has never authorized. It is only Allah Who decides.

And to that I bear witness.”  ˹Then he said to himself,˺ “By Allah! I will surely plot against your idols after you have turned your backs and gone away.”  So he smashed them into pieces, except the biggest of them, so they might turn to it ˹for answers˺.  They protested, “Who dared do this to our gods? It must be an evildoer!”  Some said, “We heard a young man, called Abraham, speaking ˹ill˺ of them.”  They demanded, “Bring him before the eyes of the people, so that they may witness ˹his trial˺.”  They asked, “Was it you who did this to our gods, O  Abraham?”  He replied ˹sarcastically˺, “No, this one—the biggest of them—did it! So ask them, if they can talk!”  So they came back to their senses, saying ˹to one another˺, “You yourselves are truly the wrongdoers!”  Then they ˹quickly˺ regressed to their ˹original˺ mind-set, ˹arguing,˺ “You already know that those ˹idols˺ cannot talk.”  He rebuked ˹them˺, “Do you then worship—instead of Allah—what can neither benefit nor harm you in any way?  Shame on you and whatever you worship instead of Allah! Do you not have any sense?”  They concluded, “Burn him up to avenge your gods, if you must act.”  We ordered, “O fire! Be cool and safe for Abraham!”1  They had sought to harm him, but We made them the worst losers.  Then We delivered him, along with Lot, to the land We had showered with blessings for all people.1  And We blessed him with Isaac ˹as a son˺ and Jacob ˹as a grandson˺, as an additional favour—making all of them righteous. We ˹also˺ made them leaders, guiding by Our command, and inspired them to do good deeds, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. And they were devoted to Our worship. And to Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and delivered him from the society engrossed in shameful practices. They were certainly an evil, rebellious people.  And We admitted him into Our mercy, ˹for˺ he was truly one of the righteous.  And ˹remember˺ when Noah had cried out to Us earlier, so We responded to him and delivered him and his family1 from the great distress.  And We made him prevail over those who had rejected Our signs. They were truly an evil people, so We drowned them all. </li>

          <li>Tsze-chang asked Confucius saying, "In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may
            conduct government properly?" The Master replied, "Let him honor the five excellent, and banish away the
            four bad, things;-then may he conduct government properly." Tsze-chang said, "What are meant by the five
            excellent things?" The Master said, "When the person in authority is beneficent without the great
            expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining (feel or express discontent; fret);
            when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being
            proud; when he is majestic without being fierce." (C.A. quote 846) Tsze-chang said, "What is meant by
            being
            beneficent without great expenditure?" The Master replied, "When the person in authority makes more
            beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;-is not this being beneficent
            without great expenditure? When he chooses the labors which are proper, and makes them labor on them, who
            will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of
            covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not
            dare
            to indicate any disrespect;-is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his
            clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with
            awe;-is
            not this to be majestic without being fierce?" (C.A. quote 848)</li>

          <li>Quran 4-97, 98, 99: When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves1—scolding them, “What do you think you were doing?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination! Except helpless men, women, and children who cannot afford a way out— it is right to hope that Allah will pardon them. For Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-116: ˹O Prophet!˺ If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would lead you away from Allah’s Way. They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-32: Ask, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions Allah has brought forth for His servants?” Say, “They are for the enjoyment of the believers in this worldly life, but they will be exclusively theirs on the Day of Judgment.1 This is how We make Our revelations clear for people of knowledge.” </li>

          <li>Quran 7-86: And do not lie in ambush on every road—threatening and hindering those who believe in Allah from His Path and striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. And consider the fate of the corruptors! </li>
          <li>Quran 9-107: There are also those ˹hypocrites˺ who set up a mosque ˹only˺ to cause harm, promote disbelief, divide the believers, and as a base for those who had previously fought against Allah and His Messenger.1 They will definitely swear, “We intended nothing but good,” but Allah bears witness that they are surely liars. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-13, 14, 15, 16, 17: The disbelievers then threatened their messengers, “We will certainly expel you from our land, unless you return to our faith.” So their Lord revealed to them, “We will surely destroy the wrongdoers, and make you reside in the land after them. This is for whoever is in awe of standing before Me and fears My warning.”  And both sides called for judgment, so every stubborn tyrant was doomed. Awaiting them is Hell, and they will be left to drink oozing pus which they will sip with difficulty, and can hardly swallow. Death will overwhelm them from every side, yet they will not ˹be able to˺ die. Awaiting them still is harsher torment</li>
          <li>Quran 14-28, 29, 30:  Have you not seen those ˹disbelievers˺ who meet Allah’s favours with ingratitude and lead their own people to their doom? In Hell they will burn. What an evil place for settlement. They set up equals to Allah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy yourselves! Surely your destination is the Fire.” </li>

So may Allah’s condemnation be upon the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-113: The Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say, “The Jews have nothing to stand on,” although both recite the Scriptures. And those ˹pagans˺ who have no knowledge say the same ˹about people of faith˺. Surely Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their dispute. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-171: The example of the disbelievers not responding to the Messenger's warning is like a flock not comprehending the calls and cries of the shepherd. They are willfully deaf, dumb and blind so they have no understanding.</li>

          <li>The Story of Bilalapadaka: the Buddha said, "My disciple, you should not think lightly of a good deed,

            khandhas) is the place where fools flounder."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Pacification of the Relatives of the Buddha: The Buddha, surveying the world with his
            supernormal powers, saw his relatives on both sides of the river coming out to meet in battle and he decided
            to stop them. All alone, he went to them by going through the sky, and stopped immediately above the middle
            of the river. His relatives seeing him, powerfully and yet peacefully sitting above them in the sky, hid
            aside all their weapons and paid obeisance to the Buddha. Then, the Buddha said to them, "For the sake of
            some water, which is of little value, you should not destroy your lives which are of so much value and
            priceless. Why have you taken this stupid action? If I had not stopped you today, your blood would have been
            flowing like a river by now. You live hating your enemies, but I have none to hate; you are ailing with
            moral defilements, but I am free from them; you are striving to have sensual pleasures, but I do not strive
            for them."</li>
          <li>The Story of Anitthigandha Kumara: When he came, the Buddha asked him why he was in such pain and distress
            and the young man related the whole story of the tragic death of his young bride. Then the Buddha said to
            him, "O Anitthigandha! Lust begets sorrow; it is due to lust for things and lust for sensual pleasures that
            sorrow and fear arise."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Brahmin: To him the Buddha replied, "Brahmin, I do not say that you are a bhikkhu simply
            because you go round for alms-food. One who professes a wrong faith and acts accordingly is not to be called
            a bhikkhu. Only he who lives meditating on the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and insubstantiality of the
            aggregates is to be called a bhikkhu."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Nigantha Ascetics: Hearing this comment, those ascetics retorted, "Yes, indeed, we do
            cover up our front part (by covering our bowls); but we cover it up not out of shame in going naked. We only
            cover up our bowls to keep away dust from our food, for even dust contains life in it."</li>
          <li>The Story of a Certain Brahmin: One day, a brahmin thought to himself, "Gotama Buddha calls his disciples

            the Buddha and posed this question. To him the Buddha replied, "I do not call one a brahmana simply because

          <li>Quran 2-247: Their prophet told them, “Allah has appointed Saul1 to be your king.” They protested, “How can he be our king when some of us are more deserving of kingship than he, and he has not been blessed with vast riches?” He replied, “Allah has chosen him over you and blessed him with knowledge and stature. Allah grants kingship to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-24: This is because they say, “The Fire will not touch us except for a few days.” They have been deceived in their faith by their wishful lying. </li>

Do not be like the unfaithful1 who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” Allah makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is Allah who gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-168: Those who sat at home, saying about their brothers, “Had they listened to us, they would not have been killed.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Try not to die1 if what you say is true!” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-178: Those who disbelieve should not think that living longer is good for them. They are only given more time to increase in sin, and they will suffer a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-185: Every soul will taste death. And you will only receive your full reward on the Day of Judgment. Whoever is spared from the Fire and is admitted into Paradise will ˹indeed˺ triumph, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-196: Do not be deceived by the prosperity of the disbelievers throughout the land. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-141: ˹The hypocrites are˺ those who wait to see what happens to you. So if Allah grants you victory, they say ˹to you˺, “Were we not on your side?” But if the disbelievers have a share ˹of victory˺, they say ˹to them˺, “Did we not have the advantage over you, yet we protected you from the believers?” Allah will judge between ˹all of˺ you on the Day of Judgment. And Allah will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers. </li>

          <li>Quran 6-137: Likewise, the pagans’ evil associates have made it appealing to them to kill their own children—only leading to their destruction as well as confusion in their faith. Had it been Allah’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their falsehood. </li>

          <li>Quran 9-25: Indeed Allah has given you ˹believers˺ victory on many battlefields, even at the Battle of Ḥunain1 when you took pride in your great numbers, but they proved of no advantage to you. The earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on you, then you turned back in retreat. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-55: So let neither their wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this worldly life, then their souls will depart while they are disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-107: Do they feel secure that an overwhelming torment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not take them by surprise when they least expect ˹it˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 17-76: They were about to intimidate you to drive you out of the land ˹of Mecca˺, but then they would not have survived after you ˹had left˺ except for a little while. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-104, 105: ˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!” It is they who reject the signs of their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We will not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day. </li>

Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺!” 
          </li>
          <li>Quran 16-33: Are they only awaiting the coming of the angels or the command of your Lord ˹O Prophet˺? So were those before them. And Allah never wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-100: Say ˹to them, O  Prophet˺, “Even if you were to possess the ˹infinite˺ treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, then you would certainly withhold ˹them˺, fearing they would run out—for humankind is ever stingy!” </li>
          <li>Quran 22-12:  They call besides Allah what can neither harm nor benefit them. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can stray. </li>

            something new. There is no one in this world who is never blamed; people would blame even a king, or even a
            Buddha. To be blamed or to be praised by a fool is of no consequence; one is truly blamed only when he is
            blamed by a wise man, and truly praised only when praised by a wise man."</li>

            deed, when he was reborn in another existence, even as a fish, he was endowed with a golden body. But that
            bhikkhu was very greedy, proud and very contemptuous of others; he also disregarded the Disciplines and
            abused other bhikkhus. For these evil deeds, he was reborn in niraya, and now, he has become a beautiful

            you have ruined us." Then, she offered alms-food to the other bhikkhus and said to them rudely, "You all

          <li>Quran 2-79: So woe1 to those who distort the Scripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a fleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-84, 85, 86: And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from the children of Israel ˹stating˺, “Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax.” But you ˹Israelites˺ turned away—except for a few of you—and were indifferent.  But here you are, killing each other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one another in sin and aggression; and when those ˹expelled˺ come to you as captives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for you.1 Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do.  These are the ones who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. So their punishment will not be reduced, nor will they be helped. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-93: And when We took your covenant and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear and disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How evil is what your ˹so-called˺ belief prompts you to do, if you ˹actually˺ believe ˹in the Torah˺!” </li>

          <li>Quran 2-206: When it is said to them, “Fear Allah,” pride carries them off to sin. Hell will be their proper place. What an evil place to rest! </li>
          <li>Quran 3-71: O People of the Book! Why do you mix the truth with falsehood and hide the truth knowingly? </li>
          <li>Quran 3-99: Say, “O People of the Book! Why do you turn the believers away from the Way of Allah—striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, while you are witnesses ˹to its truth˺? And Allah is never unaware of what you do.” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-112: They will be stricken with disgrace wherever they go, unless they are protected by a covenant with Allah or a treaty with the people.

          <li>Quran 3-187: ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when Allah took the covenant of those who were given the Scripture to make it known to people and not hide it, yet they cast it behind their backs and traded it for a fleeting gain. What a miserable profit! </li>

          <li>Quran 4-89: They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,1</li>

And whatever good you do is certainly well known to Allah.” </li>
          <li>Quran 4-150, 151: Surely those who deny Allah and His messengers and wish to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers,1 saying, “We believe in some and disbelieve in others,” desiring to forge a compromise, they are indeed the true disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-124: Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to place His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-125: Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.1 But whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-136: The pagans set aside for Allah a share of the crops and cattle He created, saying, “This ˹portion˺ is for Allah,” so they claim, “and this ˹one˺ for our associate-gods.” Yet the portion of their associate-gods is not shared with Allah while Allah’s portion is shared with their associate-gods. What unfair judgment! </li>

          <li>Quran 8-36: Surely the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder others from the Path of Allah. They will continue to spend to the point of regret. Then they will be defeated and the disbelievers will be driven into Hell, </li>
          <li>Quran 9-32: They wish to extinguish Allah’s light1 with their mouths, but Allah will only allow His light to be perfected, even to the dismay of the disbelievers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-50: If a blessing befalls you ˹O Prophet˺, they grieve, but if a disaster befalls you, they say, “We took our precaution in advance,” and turn away, rejoicing. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-64: The hypocrites fear that a sûrah should be revealed about them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Keep mocking! Allah will definitely bring to light what you fear.” </li>
          <li>Quran 9-67: The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage what is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold ˹what is in˺ their hands. They neglected Allah, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the rebellious. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-125: But as for those with sickness in their hearts,1 it has increased them only in wickedness upon their wickedness, and they die as disbelievers. 
          <li>Quran 10-66: Certainly to Allah ˹alone˺ belong all those in the heavens and all those on the earth. And what do those who associate others with Allah really follow? They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-60: They were followed by a curse in this world, as they will be on the Day of Judgment. Surely ’Âd denied their Lord. So away with ’Âd, the people of Hûd. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-79:  They argued, “You certainly know that we have no need for your daughters. You already know what we desire!” 
          <li>Quran 13-25: And those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺ Allah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land—it is they who will be condemned and will have the worst abode.1  </li>
          <li>Quran 16-58, 59: Whenever one of them is given the good news of a baby girl, his face grows gloomy, as he suppresses his rage. He hides himself from the people because of the bad news he has received. Should he keep her in disgrace, or bury her ˹alive˺ in the ground? Evil indeed is their judgment!1</li>
          <li>Quran 17-68, 69: Do you feel secure that He will not cause the land to swallow you up, or unleash upon you a storm of stones? Then you will find none to protect you. Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back to sea once again, and send upon you a violent storm, drowning you for your denial? Then you will find none to avenge you against Us. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-90, 91, 92, 93: They challenge ˹the Prophet˺, “We will never believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us, or until you have a garden of palm trees and vineyards, and cause rivers to flow abundantly in it, or cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or bring Allah and the angels before us, face to face, or until you have a house of gold, or you ascend into heaven—and even then we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book that we can read.” Say, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I not only a human messenger?” </li>
          <li>Quran 18-56: We do not send the messengers except as deliverers of good news and warners. But the disbelievers argue in falsehood, ˹hoping˺ to discredit the truth with it, and make a mockery of My revelations and warnings. </li>

            services. He also begged Thera Sariputta to accept some of the food from him. Thera Sariputta did not say
            anything to him but continued on his way. Thera Sariputta refused to accept food from that bhikkhu because
            that bhikkhu had transgressed the law prohibiting bhikkhus from practising medicine. Other bhikkhus reported
            about this to the Buddha and he said to them, "Bhikkhus! A bhikkhu who is shameless is coarse in thought,
            word and deed. He is arrogant like a crow, he would find a living by unlawful means and live in comfort. On

          <li>The Story of Some Bhikkhus: When they went to the Buddha with this proposal, the Buddha, knowing full well

            wherever there was a large gathering of people. The gist of the verses is this: "My four foolish sons are
            like ogres. They call me 'father, father', but the words come only out of their mouths and not from their
            hearts. They are deceitful and scheming. Taking the advice of their wives they have driven me out of their
            houses. So, now I have got to be begging. Those sons of mine are of less service to me than this staff of
            mine." When the old brahmin recited these verses, many people in the crowd, hearing him, went wild with rage
            at his sons and some even threatened to kill them.</li>

          <li>From day to day you are saying, 'We are not known.' If some ruler were to know you, what would you like
            to
            do?' (C.A. quote 445) Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied "Suppose the case of a state of ten thousand
            chariots; let it be straitened between other large cities; let it be suffering from invading armies; and
            to
            this let there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables:-if I were intrusted with the government of
            it, in three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to recognize the rules of righteous
            conduct." The Master smiled at him. (C.A. quote 446)</li>

          <li>Quran 2-14: When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But when alone with their evil associates
          they say, “We are definitely with you; we were only mocking.”</li>
          <li>Quran 2-51: And ˹remember˺ when We appointed forty nights for Moses, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-108: Or do you ˹believers˺ intend to ask of your Messenger as Moses was asked before?1 But whoever trades belief for disbelief has truly strayed from the Right Way. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-118: Those who have no knowledge say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign would come to us!” The same was said by those who came before. Their hearts are all alike. Indeed, We have made the signs clear for people of sure faith. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-204: There are some ˹hypocrites˺ who impress you with their views regarding worldly affairs and openly call upon Allah to witness what is in their hearts, yet they are your worst adversaries. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-224: Do not use Allah’s Name in your oaths as an excuse for not doing good, not guarding against evil, or not making peace between people. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 2-267: O believers! Donate from the best of what you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth. Do not pick out worthless things for donation, which you yourselves would only accept with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-23: Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scriptures?1 Yet when they are invited to the Book of Allah to settle their disputes, some of them turn away heedlessly. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-61, 62: When it is said to them, “Come to Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” you see the hypocrites turn away from you stubbornly. How ˹horrible˺ will it be if a disaster strikes them because of what their hands have done, then they come to you swearing by Allah, “We intended nothing but goodwill and reconciliation.”  </li>
          <li>Quran 4-112: And whoever commits an evil or sinful deed then blames it on an innocent person, they will definitely bear the guilt of slander and blatant sin. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159: The People of the Book demand that you ˹O Prophet˺ bring down for them a revelation in writing from heaven.1 They demanded what is even greater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after their repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof. We raised the Mount over them ˹as a warning˺ for ˹breaking˺ their covenant and said, “Enter the gate ˹of Jerusalem˺ with humility.” We also warned them, “Do not break the Sabbath,” and took from them a firm covenant. ˹They were condemned˺ for breaking their covenant, rejecting Allah’s signs, killing the prophets unjustly, and for saying, “Our hearts are unreceptive!”1—it is Allah Who has sealed their hearts for their disbelief, so they do not believe except for a few— and for their denial and outrageous accusation against Mary,1 and for boasting, “We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.” But they neither killed nor crucified him—it was only made to appear so.1 Even those who argue for this ˹crucifixion˺ are in doubt. They have no knowledge whatsoever—only making assumptions. They certainly did not kill him Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. Every one of the People of the Book will definitely believe in him before his death.1 And on the Day of Judgment Jesus will be a witness against them. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-36: As for the disbelievers, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over ˹and offer it all˺ to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted from them. And they will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-43: But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 5-61: When they come to you ˹believers˺ they say, “We believe.” But they are committed to disbelief when they enter and when they leave. And Allah knows what they hide. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-31: Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah until the Hour takes them by surprise, then they will cry, “Woe to us for having ignored this!” They will bear ˹the burden of˺ their sins on their backs. Evil indeed is their burden! </li>
          <li>Quran 6-157: Nor can you say, “If only the Scriptures had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.” Now there has come to you from your Lord a clear proof1—a guide and mercy. Who then does more wrong than those who deny Allah’s revelations and turn away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our revelations with a dreadful punishment for turning away. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-45: those who hindered ˹others˺ from Allah’s Way, strived to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, and disbelieved in the Hereafter.” </li>
          <li>Quran 7-134, 135: When tormented, they pleaded, “O Moses! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If you help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you.” But as soon as We removed the torment from them—until they met their inevitable fate1—they broke their promise. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-8: How ˹can they have a treaty˺? If they were to have the upper hand over you, they would have no respect for kinship or treaty. They only flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are in denial, and most of them are rebellious. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-56: They swear by Allah that they are part of you, but they are not. They only say so out of fear. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-61, 62: And there are others who hurt the Prophet by saying, “He listens to anyone.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He listens to what is best for you. He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy for those who believe among you.” Those who hurt Allah’s Messenger will suffer a painful punishment. They swear by Allah to you ˹believers˺ in order to please you, while it is the pleasure of Allah and His Messenger they should seek, if they are ˹true˺ believers. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-67, 68:  The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage what is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold ˹what is in˺ their hands. They neglected Allah, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the rebellious. Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers an everlasting stay in the Fire of Hell—it is sufficient for them. Allah has condemned them, and they will suffer a never-ending punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-75, 76: And there are some who had made a vow to Allah: “If He gives us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be of the righteous.” But when He gave them out of His bounty, they withheld it and turned away indifferently. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-98: And among the nomads are those who consider what they donate to be a loss and await your misfortune. May ill-fortune befall them! And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</li>
          <li>Quran 10-2: Is it astonishing to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves, ˹instructing him,˺ “Warn humanity and give good news to the believers that they will have an honourable status with their Lord.”? Yet the disbelievers said, “Indeed, this ˹man˺ is clearly a magician!” 
          <li>Quran 10-76: When the truth came to them from Us, they said, “This is certainly pure magic!” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-110: Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose regarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,1 their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺. They are truly in alarming doubt about it. f</li>
          <li>Quran 12-11, 12: They said, “O our father! Why do you not trust us with Joseph, although we truly wish him well? Send him out with us tomorrow so that he may enjoy himself and play. And we will really watch over him.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-9: Have you not ˹already˺ received the stories of those who were before you: the people of Noah, ’Âd, Thamûd, and those after them? Only Allah knows how many they were. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands over their mouths1 and said, “We totally reject what you have been sent with, and we are certainly in alarming doubt about what you are inviting us to.” </li>
          <li>Quran 14-21: They will all appear before Allah, and the lowly ˹followers˺ will appeal to the arrogant ˹leaders˺, “We were your ˹dedicated˺ followers, so will you ˹then˺ protect us from Allah’s torment in any way?” They will reply, “Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. ˹Now˺ it is all the same for us whether we suffer patiently or impatiently, there is no escape for us.” 
          <li>Quran 15-14, 15: And even if We opened for them a gate to heaven, through which they continued to ascend, still they would say, “Our eyes have truly been dazzled! In fact, we must have been bewitched.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-24: And when it is said to them, “What has your Lord revealed?” They say, “Ancient fables!” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-94: And do not take your oaths as a means of deceiving one another or your feet will slip after they have been firm. Then you will taste the evil ˹consequences˺ of hindering ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and you will suffer a tremendous punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 17-73: They definitely ˹thought they˺ were about to lure you away from what We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺, hoping that you would attribute something else to Us falsely—and then they would have certainly taken you as a close friend.1</li>
          <li>Quran 19-66: Yet ˹some˺ people ask ˹mockingly˺, “After I die, will I really be raised to life again?”</li>
          <li>Quran 20-63, 64: They concluded, “These two are only magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic, and do away with your most cherished traditions. So orchestrate your plan, then come forward in ˹perfect˺ ranks. And whoever prevails today will certainly be successful.” </li>
          <li>Quran 20-96: He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful ˹of dust˺ from the hoof-prints of ˹the horse of˺ the messenger-angel ˹Gabriel˺ then cast it ˹on the moulded calf˺. This is what my lower-self tempted me into.”1</li>
          <li>Quran 20-134: Had We destroyed them with a torment before this ˹Prophet came˺, they would have surely argued, “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and put to shame.” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-6: Not a ˹single˺ society We destroyed before them ever believed ˹after receiving the signs˺. Will these ˹pagans˺ then believe? </li>
          <li>Quran 21-29:  Whoever of them were to say, “I am a god besides Him,” they would be rewarded with Hell by Us. This is how We reward the wrongdoers. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada Verse 19: Though he recites much the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but is negligent and does not
            practise according to the Dhamma, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others, he has no share in the
            benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).</li>
          <li>The Story of Some Ladies Observing the Moral Precepts: When she told the Buddha about the various answers
            of the different age groups of ladies, the Buddha said, "Visakha! birth, ageing and death are always
            actively working in beings; because one is born, one is subject to ageing and decay, and finally to death.
            Yet, they do not wish to strive for liberation from the round of existences (samsara); they still wish to
            linger in samsara"</li>
          <li>The Story of Laludayi: When the Buddha was told about this incident, he said, "Laludayi had learned very
            little of the Dhamma; he does not recite the religious texts regularly; he has not memorized anything.
            Whatever little he has learned gets rusty by not reciting."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 252: It is easy to see the faults of others, but difficult to see one's own. A man
            broadcasts the fault; of others like winnowing chaff in the wind, but hides his own faults as a crafty
            fowler covers himself. </li>
          <li>The Story of Thera Bhaddiya: Whereupon, the Buddha said to them, "Bhikkhus! That person is not a samanera,
            he is a senior bhikkhu although he is small-built and very unassuming. I do say that one is not a thera just
            because he is old and looks like a thera; only he who comprehends the Four Noble Truths and does not harm
            others is to be called a thera."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Old Bhikkhus: The Buddha called those bhikkhus to him and said, "Bhikkhus! You all are
            feeling pain and sorrow because you are not free from greed, hatred, and ignorance (raga, dosa, moha), which
            are like a forest. Cut down this forest and you will be freed from greed, hatred and ignorance."</li>
          <li>The Story of Samanera Sanu: As his mother was busy cooking his meal, the ogress, who was his mother of a
            past existence, thought, "If my son Sanu leaves the Order, I shall be put to shame and become a laughing
            stock among other ogres and devas; I must try and stop him leaving the Order." So, the young samanera was
            possessed by her; the boy rolled on the floor, muttering in coherently with saliva streaming out of his
            mouth. The mother got alarmed; neighbours came and tried to appease the spirits. Then, the ogress spoke out
            "This samanera wants to leave the religious Order and return to the life of a lay man; if he does so he will
            not be able to escape from dukkha." After saying those words, the ogress left the body of the boy and the
            boy became normal again.</li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Mahapajapati Gotami: To them the Buddha replied, "Why do you say so? I myself gave the
            eight garudhammas to Mahapajapati and she had learnt and practised the garudhammas as required by me. I
            myself am her preceptor and it is quite wrong for you to say that she has no preceptor. You should harbour

            "Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness." (C.A. quote 614) The Master said,

          <li>The Master said to Po-yu, "Do you give yourself to the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan. The man who has not
            studied the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan is like one who stands with his face right against a wall. Is he not
            so?" The Master said, "It is according to the rules of propriety,' they say. Are gems and silk all that is
            meant by propriety? 'It is music,' they say. Are hers and drums all that is meant by music?" (C.A. quote
            750) The Master said, "he who puts on an appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like
            one of the small people;-yea, is he not like the thief who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?" (C.A.
            quote 751) The Master said, "Your good, careful people of the villages are the thieves of virtue." (C.A.
            quote 752) The Master said, "To tell, as we go along, what we have heard on the way, is to cast away our
            virtue." (C.A. quote 753) The Master said, "There are those mean creatures! How impossible it is along
            with
            them to serve one's prince! (C.A. quote 754) While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is how to
            get
            them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest they should lose them. (C.A. quote 755) When they are

          <li>Tsze-chang said, "When a man holds fast to virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes in

            (C.A. quote 805)</li>
          <li>The Master said, "If, because a man's discourse appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good

          <li>Quran 2-76: When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But in private they say ˹to each other˺, “Will you disclose to the believers the knowledge Allah has revealed to you,1 so that they may use it against you before your Lord? Do you not understand?” </li>
          <li>Quran 2-266: Would any of you wish to have a garden with palm trees, grapevines, and all kinds of fruits with rivers flowing underneath and as they grow very old with dependent children, a fiery whirlwind hits the garden, burning it all up? This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will reflect. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-153: ˹Remember˺ when you were running far away ˹in panic˺—not looking at anyone—while the Messenger was calling to you from behind! So Allah rewarded your disobedience with distress upon distress. Now, do not grieve over the victory you were denied or the injury you suffered. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-54: Or do they envy the people for Allah’s bounties? Indeed, We have given the descendants of Abraham the Book and wisdom, along with great authority. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-91: You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-142: Surely the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He outwits them. When they stand up for prayer, they do it half-heartedly only to be seen by people—hardly remembering Allah at all. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-143: Torn between belief and disbelief—belonging neither to these ˹believers˺ nor those ˹disbelievers˺. And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-33: We certainly know that what they say grieves you ˹O Prophet˺. It is not your honesty they question—it is Allah’s signs that the wrongdoers deny. </li>

          <li>Quran 7-131: In times of prosperity, they said, “This is what we deserve,” but in adversity, they blamed it on Moses and those with him.1 Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of them did not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 7-138: We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols. They demanded, “O Moses! Make for us a god like their gods.” He replied, “Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly! </li>
          <li>Quran 8-35: Their prayer at the Sacred House was nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for your disbelief. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-19: Do you ˹pagans˺ consider providing the pilgrims with water and maintaining the Sacred Mosque as equal to believing in Allah and the Last Day and struggling in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in Allah’s sight. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 
          <li>Quran 9-42: Had the gain been within reach and the journey shorter, they would have followed you, but the distance seemed too long for them. And they will swear by Allah, “Had we been able, we would have certainly joined you.” They are ruining themselves. And Allah knows that they are surely lying. </li>

          <li>Quran 9-54: And what prevented their donations from being accepted is that they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger, they never come to prayer except half-heartedly, and they never donate except resentfully. </li>

But when We relieve their hardship, they return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any hardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made appealing to them. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-9: If We give people a taste of Our mercy then take it away from them, they become utterly desperate, ungrateful. </li>
          <li>Quran 11-38: So he began to build the Ark, and whenever some of the chiefs of his people passed by, they mocked him. He said, “If you laugh at us, we will ˹soon˺ laugh at you similarly. </li>
          <li>Quran 12-106: And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others with Him ˹in worship˺. </li>
          <li>Quran 13-26: Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And the disbelievers become prideful of ˹the pleasures of˺ this worldly life. But the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-101: When We replace a verse with another1—and Allah knows best what He reveals—they say, “You ˹Muḥammad˺ are just a fabricator.” In fact, most of them do not know. </li>
          <li>Quran 18-106: That is their reward: Hell, for their disbelief and mockery of My signs and messengers. </li>
          <li>Quran 19-27: Then she returned to her people, carrying him. They said ˹in shock˺, “O Mary! You have certainly done a horrible thing! O  sister of Aaron!1 Your father was not an indecent man, nor was your mother unchaste.” So she pointed to the baby. They exclaimed, “How can we talk to someone who is an infant in the cradle?” ˹Jesus˺ declared, “I am truly a servant of Allah. He has destined me to be given the Scripture and to be a prophet. He has made me a blessing wherever I go, and bid me to establish prayer and give alms-tax as long as I live, and to be kind to my mother. He has not made me arrogant or defiant. Peace be upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I will be raised back to life!” That is Jesus, son of Mary. ˹And this is˺ a word of truth, about which they dispute. </li>
          <li>Quran 20-56, 57, 58, 59, 60:  And We certainly showed Pharaoh all of Our signs,1 but he denied them and refused ˹to believe˺. He said, “Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O  Moses? We can surely meet you with similar magic. So set for us an appointment that neither of us will fail to keep, in a central place.” Moses said, “Your appointment is on the Day of the Festival, and let the people be gathered mid-morning.” </li>
          <li>Quran 21-36: When the disbelievers see you ˹O Prophet˺, they only make fun of you, ˹saying,˺ “Is this the one who speaks ˹ill˺ of your gods?” while they disbelieve at the mention of the Most Compassionate. </li>
          <li>Quran 22-11: And there are some who worship Allah on the verge ˹of faith˺: if they are blessed with something good, they are content with it; but if they are afflicted with a trial, they relapse ˹into disbelief˺,1 losing this world and the Hereafter. That is ˹truly˺ the clearest loss. </li>

            arrive at the truth, for they hold wrong views.</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 72: The skill of a fool can only harm him; it destroys his merit and his wisdom (lit.,
            it severs his head). </li>
          <li>The Story of Bhikkhu Hatthaka: The Buddha called Hatthaka to him and said, "Bhikkhu! Why do you behave in
            this way? One who says such things cannot become a samana in spite of his shaven head. Only one who has rid
            himself of all evil is to be called a samana."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Baddiya Bhikkhus: When the Buddha was told about this he said, "Bhikkhus, you have

            making slippers and decorating them."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 307: Many men wearing the yellow robe up to their necks who have an evil disposition and

          <li>The Story of a Bhikkhu Who Killed a Swan (Hamsa): The Buddha reprimanded him and said, "My son, why have
            you killed this bird? Why especially you, a member of my Order, who should be practising loving-kindness to
            all beings and who should be striving ardently for liberation from the round of rebirths? Even during the
            period outside the Teaching, the wise practised morality and observed the precepts. A bhikkhu must have

          <li>The Master said, "Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the
            conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But
            it
            is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their
            aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him (C.A. quote

            that
            they are valorous. I hate those who make known secrets, and think that they are straightforward." (C.A.
            quote 773) The Master said, "Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you

            peace-makers!”1. Indeed, it is they who are the corruptors, but they fail to perceive it. And when they are
            told, “Believe as others believe,” they reply, “Will we believe as the fools believe?” Indeed, it is they

          <li>Quran 2-246: Have you not seen those chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses? They said to one of their prophets, “Appoint for us a king, ˹and˺ we will fight in the cause of Allah.” He said, “Are you not going to cower if ordered to fight?” They replied, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, while we were driven out of our homes and ˹separated from˺ our children?” But when they were ordered to fight, they fled, except for a few of them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-70: O People of the Book! Why do you reject the signs of Allah while you bear witness ˹to their truth˺? </li>
          <li>Quran 4-144: O believers! Do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Would you like to give Allah solid proof against yourselves? </li>
          <li>Quran 6-139: They ˹also˺ say, “The offspring of this cattle is reserved for our males and forbidden to our females; but if it is stillborn, they may all share it.” He will repay them for their falsehood. Surely He is All-Wise, All-Knowing. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-140: Lost indeed are those who have murdered their own children foolishly out of ignorance and have forbidden what Allah has provided for them—falsely attributing lies to Allah. They have certainly strayed and are not ˹rightly˺ guided. </li>

          <li>Quran 9-34: O believers! Indeed, many rabbis and monks consume people’s wealth wrongfully and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah. Give good news of a painful torment to those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah’s cause. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-74: They swear by Allah that they never said anything ˹blasphemous˺, while they did in fact utter a blasphemy, lost faith after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not carry out.1 It is only through resentment that they pay Allah and His Messenger back for enriching them out of His bounty! If they repent, it will be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no one on earth to protect or help them. 
          <li>Quran 9-101: Some of the nomads around you ˹believers˺ are hypocrites, as are some of the people of Medina. They have mastered hypocrisy.

      <h4>The prophets on foolish people</h4>
      <div class="the-topics">
        <ul>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 73: The foolish bhikkhu desires praise for qualities he does not have, precedence among
            bhikkhus, authority in the monasteries, and veneration from those unrelated to him.

            Verse 74: "Let both laymen and bhikkhus think that things are done because of me; let them obey me in all
            matters, great and small." Such being the thoughts of the fool, his greed and his pride grow.</li>
          <li>The Story or Bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka: "Tell those bhikkhus not to destroy the faith and
            generosity of the lay disciples by misconduct and if anyone should disobey, drive him out of the
            monastery. Do not hesitate to do as I told you, for only fools dislike being given good advice and being
            forbidden to do evil."</li>
          <li>The Story of Five Hundred Bhikkhus: "It is in the nature of the foolish to be full of sorrow and feel
            depressed when things go wrong, and to be full of gladness and feel elated when things go well. The wise,
            however, can withstand the ups and downs of life."</li>
          <li>The Story of the Son of Mahadhana: "Ananda, look at this son of a very rich man; he had lived a useless
            life, an aimless life of pleasure. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the first stage of his life
            he would have been a top-ranking rich man; or if he had become a bhikkhu, he could have been an arahat, and
            his wife could have been an anagami. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the second stage of his
            life he would have been a second rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been an anagami,
            and his wife could have been a sakadagami. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the third stage of
            his life he would have been a third rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been a
            sakadagami, and his wife could have been a sotapanna. However, because he had done nothing in all the three
            stages of his life he had lost all his worldly riches, he had also lost all opportunities of attaining any
            of the Maggas and Phalas."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 162: As the creeper (maluva) strangle the sal tree, so also, a really immoral person
            (overwhelmed by Craving) does to himself just what his enemy wishes him to do. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 164: The foolish man who, on account of his wrong views, scorns the teaching of
            homage-worthy Noble Ones (Ariyas) who live according to the Dhamma is like the bamboo which bears fruit for
            its own destruction. </li>

          <li>Dhammapada: Verse 177: Indeed, misers do not go to the abode of the devas; fools do not praise charity;
            but the wise rejoice in charity and so gain happiness in the life hereafter. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 207: He who walks in the company of fools has to grieve for a long time. Association with
            fools is ever painful, as living with an enemy; association with the wise is a pleasure, as living with
            relatives.</li>
          <li>The Story of a Group of Six Bhikkhus: When the Buddha was told about this, he said, "Bhikkhus! I do not
            say that one who talks much, abuses and bullies others is a wise man. Only he who is free from hatred, and
            harms no one is a wise man."</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 286: "Here will I live in the rainy season; here will I live in the cold season and the
            hot season", so imagines the fool, not realizing the danger (of approaching death). </li>
          <li>The Story of Theri Khema: The Buddha knowing the state of her mind remarked, "O Khema! Look carefully at
            this decaying body which is built around a skeleton of bones and is subject to disease and decay. Look
            carefully at the body which is thought of so highly by the foolish. Look at the worthlessness of the beauty
            of this young girl." After hearing this, Queen Khema attained Sotapatti Fruition</li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 355: Wealth destroys the foolish; but it cannot destroy those who seek the other shore
            (i.e., Nibbana). By his craving for wealth the fool destroys himself, as he would destroy others. </li>
          <li>Dhammapada Verse 394: O foolish one! What is the use of wearing matted hair? What is the use of your
            wearing a garment made of antelope skin? In you, there is a forest (of moral defilements); you clean
            yourself only externally.</li>

          <li>Quran 4-10: Indeed, those who unjustly consume orphans’ wealth ˹in fact˺ consume nothing but fire into their bellies. And they will be burned in a blazing Hell! </li>

          <li>Quran 6-129: This is how We make the wrongdoers ˹destructive˺ allies of one another because of their misdeeds. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-21: When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a hardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is swifter in devising ˹punishment˺. Surely Our messenger-angels record whatever you devise.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-8: And if We delay their punishment until an appointed time, they will definitely say, “What is holding it back?” Indeed, on the Day it overtakes them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
          <li>Quran 14-46: They devised every plot, which was fully known to Allah, but their plotting was not enough to ˹even˺ overpower mountains ˹let alone Allah˺. </li>

          <li>Quran 19-77: Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ the one1 who rejects Our revelations yet boasts, “I will definitely be granted ˹plenty of˺ wealth and children ˹if there is an afterlife˺.”? </li>

          <li>Quran 2-75: Do you ˹believers still˺ expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it? </li>
          <li>Quran 2-126: And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city ˹of Mecca˺ secure and provide fruits to its people—those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” He answered, “As for those who disbelieve, I will let them enjoy themselves for a little while, then I will condemn them to the torment of the Fire. What an evil destination!” </li>
          <li>Quran 3-75: There are some among the People of the Book who, if entrusted with a stack of gold, will readily return it. Yet there are others who, if entrusted with a single coin, will not repay it unless you constantly demand it. This is because they say, “We are not accountable for ˹exploiting˺ the Gentiles.”1 And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-79: It is not appropriate for someone who Allah has blessed with the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood to say to people, “Worship me instead of Allah.” Rather, he would say, “Be devoted to the worship of your Lord ˹alone˺”—in accordance with what these prophets read in the Scripture and what they taught. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-119: Here you are! You love them but they do not love you, and you believe in all Scriptures. When they meet you they say, “We believe.” But when alone, they bite their fingertips in rage. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹May you˺ die of your rage!” Surely Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. </li>
          <li>Quran 3-188: Do not let those who rejoice in their misdeeds and love to take credit for what they have not done think they will escape torment. They will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-18: However, repentance is not accepted from those who knowingly persist in sin until they start dying, and then cry, “Now I repent!” nor those who die as disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-49: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who ˹falsely˺ elevate themselves? It is Allah who elevates whoever He wills. And none will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-60: Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who claim they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They seek the judgment of false judges, which they were commanded to reject. And Satan ˹only˺ desires to lead them farther away. </li>
          <li>Quran 4-81: And they say, “We obey,” but when they leave you, a group of them would spend the night contradicting what they said. Allah records all their schemes. So turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs. </li>
          <li>Quran 6-28: But no! ˹They only say this˺ because the truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. Even if they were to be sent back, they would certainly revert to what they were forbidden. Indeed they are liars! </li>
          <li>Quran 6-81: And how should I fear your associate-gods, while you have no fear in associating ˹others˺ with Allah—a practice He has never authorized? Which side has more right to security? ˹Tell me˺ if you really know!” </li>
          <li>Quran 8-56: ˹namely˺ those with whom you ˹O Prophet˺ have entered into treaties, but they violate them every time, not fearing the consequences. </li>
          <li>Quran 9-48: They had already sought to spread discord before1 and devised every ˹possible˺ plot against you ˹O Prophet˺, until the truth came and Allah’s Will prevailed—much to their dismay. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-33: And so your Lord’s decree has been proven true against the rebellious—that they will never believe. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-39: In fact, they ˹hastily˺ rejected the Book without comprehending it and before the fulfilment of its warnings. Similarly, those before them were in denial. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers! </li>
          <li>Quran 10-42, 43, 44: Some of them listen to what you say, but can you make the deaf hear even though they do not understand? And some of them look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they cannot see?1 Indeed, Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves. </li>
          <li>Quran 10-77:  Moses responded, “Is this what you say about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? Magicians will never succeed.” </li>
          <li>Quran 11-10: But if We give them a taste of prosperity after being touched with adversity, they say, “My ills are gone,” and become totally prideful and boastful, </li>
          <li>Quran 11-48: It was said, “O Noah! Disembark with Our peace and blessings on you and some of the descendants of those with you. As for the others, We will allow them ˹a brief˺ enjoyment, then they will be touched with a painful punishment from Us.” </li>
          <li>Quran 12-25: They raced for the door and she tore his shirt from the back, only to find her husband at the door. She cried, “What is the penalty for someone who tried to violate your wife, except imprisonment or a painful punishment?” </li>
          <li>Quran 13-5: ˹Now,˺ if anything should amaze you ˹O Prophet˺, then it is their question: “When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new creation?” It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord. It is they who will have shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-21: They are dead, not alive—not even knowing when their followers will be resurrected. </li>
          <li>Quran 16-36: We surely sent a messenger to every community, saying, “Worship Allah and shun false gods.” But some of them were guided by Allah, while others were destined to stray. So travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers! </li>
          <li>Quran 16-86: And when the polytheists see their associate-gods, they will say, “Our Lord! These are our associate-gods that we used to invoke besides You.” Their gods will throw a rebuttal at them, ˹saying,˺ “You are definitely liars.” </li>
          <li>Quran 16-106, 107: Whoever disbelieves in Allah after their belief—not those who are forced while their hearts are firm in faith,1 but those who embrace disbelief wholeheartedly—they will be condemned by Allah and suffer a tremendous punishment. This is because they prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter. Surely Allah never guides those who ˹choose to˺ disbelieve. </li>
          <li>Quran 21-2, 3:  Whatever new reminder comes to them from their Lord, they only listen to it jokingly, with their hearts ˹totally˺ distracted. The evildoers would converse secretly, ˹saying,˺ “Is this ˹one˺ not human like yourselves? Would you fall for ˹this˺ witchcraft, even though you can ˹clearly˺ see?” </li>

    <h4>The prophets on evil deeds</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 71: An evil deed does not immediately bear fruit, just as the newly-drawn milk does not
          curdle at once; but it follows the fool burning him like live coal covered with ashes. </li>
        <li>The Story of Three Groups of Persons: The Buddha answer to the first group: "Bhikkhus, once there was a
          farmer who had an ox. The ox was very lazy and also very stubborn. It could not be coaxed to do any work; it
          would lie down chewing the cud or else go to sleep. The farmer lost his temper many times on account of this
          lazy, stubborn animal; so in anger he tied a straw rope round the neck of the ox and set fire to it, and the
          ox died. On account of this evil deed the, farmer had suffered for a long time in niraya, and in serving out
          the remaining part of his punishment, he had been burnt to death in the last seven existences."

          The Buddha's answer to the second group: "Bhikkhus, once there was a woman who had a pet dog. She used to take
          the dog along with her wherever she went and young boys of the city poked fun at her. She was very angry and
          felt so ashamed that she planned to kill the dog. She filled a pot with sand, tied it round the neck of the
          dog and threw it into the water; and the dog was drowned. On account of this evil deed that woman had suffered
          for a long time in niraya and in serving the remaining part of her punishment, she had been thrown into the
          water to drown in the last one hundred existences."

          The Buddha's answer to the third group: "Bhikkhus, once, seven cowherds saw an iguana going into a mound and
          they dosed all the seven outlets of the mound with twigs and branches of trees. After closing the outlets they
          went away, completely forgetting the iguana that was trapped in the mound. Only after seven days, they
          remembered what they had done and hurriedly returned to the scene of their mischief and let out the iguana. On
          account of this evil deed, those seven had been imprisoned together for seven days without any food, in the
          last fourteen existences."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 127: Not in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean, nor in the cave of a mountain, nor
          anywhere else, is there a place, where one may escape from the consequences of an evil deed. </li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Kondadhana: The bhikkhus then reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha sent for
          Kodadadhana and said to him, "My son, did you see any woman with the other bhikkhus that you have talked to
          them thus? You have not seen any woman with them as they have seen one with you. I see that you do not realize
          that you have been cursed on account of an evil deed done by you in a past existence. Now listen, I shall
          explain to you why you have an image of a woman following you about.

          "You were a deva in your last existence. During that time, there were two bhikkhus who were very much attached
          to each other. But you tried to create trouble between the two, by assuming the appearance of a woman and
          following one of the bhikkhus. For that evil deed you are now being followed by the image of a woman. So, my
          son, in future do not argue with other bhikkhus any more; keep silent like a gong with the rim broken off and
          you will realize Nibbana."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 137: He who does harm with weapons to those who are harmless and should not be harmed will
          soon come to any of these ten evil consequences:
          Verses 138, 139 & 140: He will be subject to severe pain, or impoverishment, or injury to the body (i.e., loss
          of limbs), or serious illness (e.g., leprosy), or lunacy, or misfortunes following the wrath of the king, or
          wrongful and serious accusations, or loss of relatives, or destruction of wealth, or the burning down of his
          houses by fire or by lightning. After the dissolution of his body, the fool will be reborn in the plane of
          continuous suffering (niraya).</li>
        <li>The Story of Bodhirajakumara: In one of their past existences, the prince and his wife were the sole
          survivors of a shipwreck. They were stranded on a deserted island, and there they lived by eating birds' eggs,
          fledglings and birds, without any feeling of remorse at any time. For that evil deed, they would not be
          blessed with any children. If they had felt even a slight remorse for their deed at any stage of their lives,
          they could have a child or two in this existence. Then turning to the prince, the Buddha said, "One who loves
          himself should guard himself in all stages of life, or at least, during one stage in his life."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 161: The evil done by oneself, arising in oneself, and caused by oneself, destroys the
          foolish one, just as a diamond grinds the rock from which it is formed. </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verses 246 & 247: He who destroys life, tells lies, takes what is not given him, commits adultery
          and takes intoxicating drinks, digs up his own roots even in this very life.
          Verse 248: Know this, O man! Not restraining oneself is evil; do not let greed and ill will subject you to
          prolonged misery.</li>
        <li>The Story of a Swine-Peta: Then the Buddha exhorted, "A bhikkhu should be calm and well-restrained in
          thought, word and deed."</li>
        <li>The Story of Those Who Suffered for Their Evil Deeds: On hearing the statement about those bhikkhus, the
          Buddha said, "During the time of Kassapa Buddha, those bhikkhus had done much evil. For those evil deeds they
          had suffered in niraya and now they are serving out the remaining term of suffering as petas."</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Sivali: To them the Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! In a previous existence, Sivali was the
          son of a king who lost his kingdom to another king. In trying to regain their kingdom he had besieged the city
          on the advice of his mother. As a result, the people in the city were without food or water for seven days. It
          was for this evil deed that Sivali was imprisoned in his mother's womb for seven years. But now, Sivali has
          come to the end of all dukkha; he has realized Nibbana."</li>

        <li>Quran 3-117: The good they do in this worldly life is like the harvest of an evil people struck by a bitter wind, destroying it ˹completely˺. Allah never wronged them, but they wronged themselves. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-137: Similar situations came to pass before you, so travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-123: ˹Divine grace is˺ neither by your wishes nor those of the People of the Book! Whoever commits evil will be rewarded accordingly, and they will find no protector or helper besides Allah. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-33: Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.1</li>
        <li>Quran 6-120: Shun all sin—open and secret. Indeed, those who commit sin will be punished for what they earn. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-78: Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them, and they fell lifeless in their homes. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-146: I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-17: It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they openly profess disbelief. Their deeds are void, and they will be in the Fire forever. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-69: ˹You hypocrites are˺ like those ˹disbelievers˺ before you. They were far superior to you in might and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share in this life. You have enjoyed your share, just as they did. And you have engaged in idle talk, just as they did. Their deeds have become void in this world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-87: They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and their hearts have been sealed so they do not comprehend. </li>
        <li>Quran 10-27: As for those who commit evil, the reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. Humiliation will cover them—with no one to protect them from Allah—as if their faces were covered with patches of the night’s deep darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. </li>
        <li>Quran 13-34: For them is punishment in this worldly life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is truly far worse. And none can shield them from Allah. </li>
        <li>Quran 14-18: The parable of the deeds of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that of ashes fiercely blown away by wind on a stormy day. They will gain nothing from what they have earned. That is ˹truly˺ the farthest one can stray. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-34:  Then the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds overtook them, and they were overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule. </li>
        <li>Quran 19-79: Not at all! We certainly record whatever he claims and will increase his punishment extensively. </li>
        <li>Quran 19-86: and drive the wicked to Hell like a thirsty herd. </li>
        <li>Quran 20-61, 62: Moses warned the magicians, “Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against Allah,1 or He will wipe you out with a torment. Whoever fabricates ˹lies˺ is bound to fail.” So the magicians disputed the matter among themselves, conversing privately. </li>
        <li>Quran 20-97: Moses said, “Go away then! And for ˹the rest of your˺ life you will surely be crying, ‘Do not touch ˹me˺!’1 Then you will certainly have a fate2 that you cannot escape. Now look at your god to which you have been devoted: we will burn it up, then scatter it in the sea completely.” </li>

        <li>Dhammapada Verse 1: All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they
          are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, 'dukkha' 3 follows him just as the wheel follows the
          hoofprint of the ox that draws the cart.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 15: Here he grieves, hereafter he grieves; the evil-doer grieves in both existences. He
          grieves and he suffers anguish when he sees the depravity of his own deeds.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 17: Here he is tormented, hereafter he is tormented; the evil-doer is tormented in both
          existences. He is tormented, and he laments: "Evil have I done." He is even more tormented when he is reborn
          in one of the lower worlds (Apaya).</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 21: Mindfulness is the way to the Deathless (Nibbana); unmindfulness is the way to Death.
          Those who are mindful do not die; those who are not mindful are as if already dead.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Seyyasaka: Then, the Buddha added, "This kind of offence can only lead to evil results in
          this world as well as in the next."</li>
        <li>The Story of an Anagami Thera: The Buddha replied, "Bhikkhus! Your teacher, who was an Anagami before he
          passed away, is now reborn in the abodes of the Brahmas (Suddhavasa Brahmaloka). He did not reveal his
          attainment of Anagami Magga because he felt ashamed that he had achieved only that much, and he was ardently
          striving to attain arahatship. Your teacher is now freed from the attachment to the sensual world (kamaloka)
          and would certainly rise to higher realms."</li>
        <li>The Story of the Brahmin who had been the 'Father of the Buddha': The Buddha then replied, "Bhikkhus, they
          called me son because I was a son or a nephew to each of them for one thousand five hundred existences in the
          past." </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 306: One who tells lies (about others) goes to niraya; one who has done evil and says "I
          did not do it" also goes to niraya. Both of them being evil-doers, suffer alike (in niraya) in their next
          existence.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 318: Beings who imagine wrong in what is not wrong, who do not see wrong in what is wrong,
          and who hold wrong views go to a lower plane of existence (duggati).
          Verse 319: Beings who know what is wrong as wrong. who know what is right as right, and who hold right views
          go to a happy plane of existence (suggati).</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Santakaya: It is said that lions usually go out in search of food one day and then rest
          in a cave for the next seven days without moving. Thera Santakaya, having been a lion in his last existence,
          behaved very much like a lion. He moved about very little; his moments were slow and steady; and he was
          usually calm and composed. Other bhikkhus took his behaviour to be very queer and they reported about him to
          the Buddha.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Vangisa: The Buddha, knowing their intention, instructed the bhikkhus to bring the skulls
          of a person reborn in niraya, of a person reborn in the animal world, of a person reborn in the human world,
          of a person reborn in the deva world and also of an arahat. The five were then placed in a row. When Vangisa
          was shown those skulls he could tell where the owners of the first four skulls were reborn but when he came to
          the skull of the arahat he was at a loss. </li>

        <li>Quran 3-56: As for those who disbelieve, I will subject them to a severe punishment in this life and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-77: Indeed, those who trade Allah’s covenant and their oaths for a fleeting gain will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them, nor purify them on the Day of Judgment. And they will suffer a painful punishment. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-180: And do not let those who ˹greedily˺ withhold Allah’s bounties think it is good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed ˹by their necks˺ on the Day of Judgment with whatever ˹wealth˺ they used to withhold. And Allah is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-56: Surely those who reject Our signs, We will cast them into the Fire. Whenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it so they will ˹constantly˺ taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-145: Surely the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire—and you will never find for them any helper— </li>
        <li>Quran 6-32: This worldly life is no more than play and amusement, but far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?</li>
        <li>Quran 7-38: Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with the ˹evil˺ groups of jinn and humans that preceded you.” Whenever a group enters Hell, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord! They have misled us, so multiply their torment in the Fire.” He will answer, “It has already been multiplied for all, but you do not know.” </li>
        <li>Quran 7-41: Hell will be their bed; flames will be their cover. This is how We reward the wrongdoers. </li>
        <li>Quran 8-14: That ˹worldly punishment˺ is yours, so taste it! Then the disbelievers will suffer the torment of the Fire. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-35: The Day ˹will come˺ when their treasure will be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, sides, and backs branded with it. ˹It will be said to them,˺ “This is the treasure you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste what you hoarded!” </li>
        <li>Quran 9-63: Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will be in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace. </li>
        <li>Quran 9-94: They will make excuses to you ˹believers˺ when you return to them. Say, “Make no excuses, ˹for˺ we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us about your ˹true˺ state ˹of faith˺. Your ˹future˺ deeds will be observed by Allah and His Messenger as well. And you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.” </li>
        <li>Quran 10-52: Then the wrongdoers will be told, “Taste the torment of eternity! Are you not rewarded except for what you used to commit?” </li>
        <li>Quran 11-16: It is they who will have nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. Their efforts in this life will be fruitless and their deeds will be useless. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-17: ˹Can these people be compared to˺ those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear proof from their Lord, backed by ˹the Quran as˺ a witness from Him, and preceded by the Book of Moses ˹which was revealed˺ as a guide and mercy? It is those ˹believers˺ who have faith in it. But whoever from the ˹disbelieving˺ groups rejects it, the Fire will be their destiny. So do not be in doubt of it. It is certainly the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-99: They were followed by a curse in this ˹life˺ and ˹will receive another˺ on the Day of Judgment. What an evil gift to receive! </li>
        <li>Quran 11-103: Surely in this is a sign for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which humanity will be gathered and a Day ˹that will be˺ witnessed ˹by all˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-107: staying there forever, as long as the heavens and the earth will endure, except what your Lord wills.1 Surely your Lord does what He intends. </li>
        <li>Quran 14-23: Those who believe and do good will be admitted into Gardens, under which rivers flow—to stay there forever by the Will of their Lord—where they will be greeted with “Peace!” </li>
        <li>Quran 16-29: So enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever. Indeed, what an evil home for the arrogant!” </li>
        <li>Quran 16-38, 39: They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that Allah will never raise the dead to life. Yes ˹He will˺! It is a true promise binding on Him, but most people do not know. ˹He will do that˺ to make clear to them what they disagreed on, and for the disbelievers to know that they were liars. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-41: As for those who emigrated in ˹the cause of˺ Allah after being persecuted, We will surely bless them with a good home in this world. But the reward of the Hereafter is far better, if only they knew. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-84: ˹Consider, O  Prophet,˺ the Day We will call ˹a prophet as˺ a witness from every faith-community. Then the disbelievers will neither be allowed to plead nor appease ˹their Lord˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-111: ˹Consider˺ the Day ˹when˺ every soul will come pleading for itself, and each will be paid in full for what it did, and none will be wronged. </li>
        <li>Quran 17-21: See how We have favoured some over others ˹in this life˺, but the Hereafter is certainly far greater in rank and in favour. </li>
        <li>Quran 17-49, 50, 51, 52:  And they say ˹mockingly˺, “When we are reduced to bones and ashes, will we really be raised as a new creation?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Yes, even if˺ you become stones, or iron, or whatever you think is harder to bring to life!” Then they will ask ˹you˺, “Who will bring us back ˹to life˺?” Say, “The One Who created you the first time.” They will then shake their heads at you and ask, “When will that be?” Say, “Perhaps it is soon!” On the Day He will call you, you will ˹instantly˺ respond by praising Him,1 thinking you had remained ˹in the world˺ only for a little while. </li>
        <li>Quran 17-97: Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, you will find no guardians for them besides Him. And We will drag them on their faces on the Day of Judgment—deaf, dumb, and blind. Hell will be their home. Whenever it dies down, We will flare it up for them. </li>
        <li>Quran 18-29: And say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord. Whoever wills let them believe, and whoever wills let them disbelieve.” Surely We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will ˹completely˺ surround them. When they cry for aid, they will be aided with water like molten metal, which will burn ˹their˺ faces. What a horrible drink! And what a terrible place to rest! </li>
        <li>Quran 18-31: It is they who will have the Gardens of Eternity, with rivers flowing under their feet. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade, reclining there on ˹canopied˺ couches. What a marvellous reward! And what a fabulous place to rest</li>
        <li>Quran 18-53: The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no way to avoid it. </li>
        <li>Quran 19-68, 69, 70, 71, 72: By your Lord ˹O Prophet˺! We will surely gather them along with the devils, and then set them around Hell on their knees.  Then We will certainly begin by dragging out of every group the ones most defiant to the Most Compassionate. And We truly know best who is most deserving of burning in it. There is none of you who will not pass over it.1 ˹This is˺ a decree your Lord must fulfil. Then We will deliver those who were devout, leaving the wrongdoers there on their knees. </li>
        <li>Quran 20-55: From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will bring you back again. 
        <li>Quran 20-102:  ˹Beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown,1 and We will gather the wicked on that Day blue-faced ˹from horror and thirst˺.2</li>
        <li>Quran 21-39: If only the disbelievers knew that a time will come when they will not be able to keep the Fire off their faces or backs, nor will they be helped. </li>
        <li>Quran 21-98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103:  Certainly you ˹disbelievers˺ and whatever you worship instead of Allah will be the fuel of Hell.1 You are ˹all˺ bound to enter it.  Had those idols been ˹true˺ gods, they would not have entered it. And they will be there forever.  In it they will groan, and will not be able to hear.  Surely those for whom We have destined the finest reward will be kept far away from Hell,  not even hearing the slightest hissing from it. And they will delight forever in what their souls desire.  The Supreme Horror ˹of that Day˺ will not disturb them, and the angels will greet them, ˹saying,˺ “This is your Day, which you have been promised.” </li>
        <li>Quran 21-104: On that Day We will roll up the heavens like a scroll of writings. Just as We produced the first creation, ˹so˺ shall We reproduce it. That is a promise binding on Us. We truly uphold ˹Our promises˺!  Surely, following the ˹heavenly˺ Record, We decreed in the Scriptures: “My righteous servants shall inherit the land.”1 </li>
        <li>Quran 22-7: And certainly the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it. And Allah will surely resurrect those in the graves. </li>
        <li>Quran 22-19, 20: These are two opposing groups that disagree about their Lord: as for the disbelievers, garments of Fire will be cut out for them and boiling water will be poured over their heads, melting whatever is in their bellies, along with their skin. </li>
        <li>Quran 22-21, 22, 23, 24, 25: And awaiting them are maces of iron. Whenever they try to escape from Hell—out of anguish—they will be forced back into it, ˹and will be told,˺ “Taste the torment of burning!”  ˹But˺ Allah will surely admit those who believe and do good into Gardens, under which rivers flow, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing will be silk, for they have been guided to the best of speech, and they have been guided to the Commendable Path.1   Indeed, those who persist in disbelief and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah and from the Sacred Mosque1—which We have appointed for all people, residents and visitors alike—along with whoever intends to deviate by doing wrong in it,2 We will cause them to taste a painful punishment. </li>

    <h4>The prophets on animals having souls</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>The Story of Devadatta: "Once, while King Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, the future Buddha was born
          as a deer, and Devadatta was then a deer-stalker. One day, the deer-stalker saw the footprints of a deer under
          a tree. So, he put up a bamboo platform in the tree and waited with the spear ready for the deer. The deer
          came but he came very cautiously. The deer-stalker saw him hesitating, and threw some fruits of the tree to
          coax him. But that put the deer on guard; he looked more carefully and saw the deer-stalker in the tree. He
          pretended not to see the deer stalker and turned away slowly. From some distance, he addressed the tree thus:

          'O tree! You always drop your fruits vertically, but today you have broken the law of nature and have dropped
          your fruits slantingly. Since you have violated the nature law of trees, I am now leaving you for another
          tree.'

          "Seeing the deer turning away, the dear-stalker dropped his spear to the ground and said, 'Yes, you can now
          move on; for today, I have been wrong in my calculations.' The deer who was the Buddha-to-be replied, 'O
          hunter! You have truly miscalculated today, but your evil kamma will not take any mistake; it will certainly
          follow you.' Thus, Devadatta had attempted to kill me not only now but also in the past, yet he had never
          succeeded." 'Then the Buddha continued, 'Bhikkhus! Just as a creeper strangles the tree to which it clings, so
          also, those without morality, being overwhelmed by lust, are finally thrown into niraya."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 320: As an elephant in battlefield withstands the arrow shot from a bow, so shall I endure
          abuse. Indeed, many people are without morality.
          Verse 321: Only the trained (horses and elephants) are led to gatherings of people; the King mounts only the
          trained (horses and elephants). Noblest among men are the tamed, who endure abuse.
          Verse 322: Mules, thoroughbred horses, horses from Sindh, and great elephants are noble only when they are
          trained; but one who has tamed himself (through Magga Insight) is far nobler.</li>
        <li>The Story of the Bhikkhu Who Had Been a Trainer of Elephants: The Buddha called the ex-elephant trainer
          bhikkhu to him and said, "O vain bhikkhu, who is yet far away from Magga and Phala ! You do not gain anything
          by taming elephants. There is no one who can get to a place where one has never been before (i.e.. Nibbana) by
          taming elephants; only one who has tamed himself can get there."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 324: The elephant called Dhanapala, in severe must and uncontrollable, being in captivity,
          eats not a morsel, yearning for his native forest (i. e., longing to look after his parents). </li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 327: Take delight in mindfulness, guard your mind well. As an elephant stuck in mire pulls
          itself out, so also, pull yourself out of the mire of moral defilements. </li>
        <li>The Story of a Number of Bhikkhus: "Venerable Sir! You must have had a hard time spending the vassa all
          alone in this forest."
          To this, the Buddha replied,"Bhikkhus, do not say so; the elephant Palileyyaka had been looking after me all
          this time. He was, indeed, a very good friend, a true friend. If one has such a good friend one should stick
          to him; but if one cannot find a good friend it is better to stay alone."</li>
        <li>The Story of Two Brahmins: So they went to the bank of the Aciravati River and there they filled up a cart
          with sand. One after the other, the bullocks pulled the cart, but they only pulled in vain, because the cart,
          did not move and only the ropes broke off. The bhikkhus seeing this reported to the Buddha and the Buddha said
          to them, "Bhikkhus! It is easy to break off the straps which you can see with your eyes; anyone can break them
          or cut them. But my sons, a bhikkhu should cut the strap of ill will and the thong of craving which are within
          you and which bind you."</li>
        <li>The Story of Angulimala: However, they could get only four hundred and ninety-nine trained elephants and so
          they had to put in an untrained elephant and it was allotted to hold the umbrella over Thera Angulimala. Every
          one was afraid that the untrained elephant might give trouble, but when brought near Thera Angulimala it was
          quite docile.</li>

        <li>Quran 3-49: and ˹make him˺ a messenger to the Children of Israel ˹to proclaim,˺ ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will make for you a bird from clay, breathe into it, and it will become a ˹real˺ bird—by Allah’s Will. I will heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead to life—by Allah’s Will. And I will prophesize what you eat and store in your houses. Surely in this is a sign for you if you ˹truly˺ believe. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-31: Then Allah sent a crow digging ˹a grave˺ in the ground ˹for a dead crow˺, in order to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I ˹even˺ failed to be like this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.1  </li>
        <li>Quran 6-38: All living beings roaming the earth and winged birds soaring in the sky are communities like yourselves.1 We have left nothing out of the Record.2 Then to their Lord they will be gathered all together. </li>
        <li>Quran 6-138: They say, “These cattle and crops are reserved—none may eat them except those we permit,” so they claim. Some other cattle are exempted from labour and others are not slaughtered in Allah’s Name—falsely attributing lies to Him. He will repay them for their lies. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-73: And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord: this is Allah’s she-camel as a sign to you. So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s land and do not harm her, or else you will be overcome by a painful punishment. 
        <li>Quran 7-179: Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-6: There is no moving creature on earth whose provision is not guaranteed by Allah. And He knows where it lives and where it is laid to rest. All is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.1 </li>

    <h4>The prophets on death</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>The Story of a Rich Householder: To him the Buddha said, "My disciple, death does not occur only in one
          place. All beings that are born must die one day; indeed, life ends in death. You must ever be mindful of the
          fact that life ends in death. Do not imagine that only your beloved son is subject to death. Do not be so
          distressed or be so shaken. Sorrow and fear arise out of affection."</li>
        <li>The Story of Mahadhana, a Merchant: Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled and the Buddha replied, "Ananda,
          do you see that merchant? He is thinking that he would stay here and sell his goods the whole year. He is not
          aware that he would die here in seven days' time. What should be done should be done today. Who would know
          that one would die tomorrow? We have no date fixed with the King of Death. For one who is mindful by day or by
          night, who is not disturbed by moral defilements and is energetic, to live for just one night is a well-spent
          life."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 287: The man who dotes on his children and his herds of cattle, whose mind longs for and is
          attached to sensual pleasures, is carried away by Death even as a sleeping village is swept away by a great
          flood.</li>
        <li>The Story of Kisagotami: To her the Buddha said, "Kisagotami, you think you are the only one who has lost a
          son. Death comes to all beings; before their desires are satiated Death takes them away."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 288: Not sons, nor parents, nor close relatives can protect one assailed by Death; indeed,
          neither kith nor kin can give protection.
          Verse 289: Knowing this, the wise man restrained by morality should quickly clear (the obstacles to) the Path
          leading to Nibbana.</li>

          Quran 2-19: Or ˹those caught in˺ a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press
          their fingers into their ears at the sound of every thunder-clap for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the
          disbelievers ˹by His might˺.
        </li>
        <li>Quran 2-132: This was the advice of Abraham—as well as Jacob—to his children, ˹saying˺, “Indeed, Allah has chosen for you this faith; so do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission.” </li>
        <li>Quran 2-154: Never say that those martyred in the cause of Allah are dead-in fact, they are alive! But you do not percieve it.</li>
        <li>Quran 3-102: O believers! Be mindful of Allah in the way He deserves,1 and do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission ˹to Him˺.2</li>
        <li>Quran 3-145: No soul can ever die without Allah’s Will at the destined time. Those who desire worldly gain, We will let them have it, and those who desire heavenly reward, We will grant it to them. And We will reward those who are grateful. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-169: Never think of those martyred in the cause of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive with their Lord, well provided for— </li>
        <li>Quran 4-78: Wherever you may be, death will overcome you—even if you were in fortified towers.” When something good befalls them, they say, “This is from Allah,” but when something evil befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Both have been destined by Allah.” So what is the matter with these people? They can hardly comprehend anything! </li>
        <li>Quran 5-106: O believers! When death approaches any of you, call upon two just Muslim men to witness as you make a bequest; otherwise, two non-Muslims if you are afflicted with death while on a journey.1 If you doubt ˹their testimony˺, keep them after prayer and let them testify under oath ˹saying˺, “By Allah! We would never sell our testimony for any price, even in favour of a close relative, nor withhold the testimony of Allah. Otherwise, we would surely be sinful.” </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>The prophets on attachment</h4>
    <div class="the-topics">
      <ul>
        <li>The Story of Thera Tissa: Later, the Buddha was asked by the bhikkhus why he had told them to wait for seven
          days before sharing out the robes of Thera Tissa. To them the Buddha replied, "My sons, Tissa had his mind
          attached to this particular set of robes at the time of his death, and so he was reborn as a louse and stayed
          in the folds of the robes. When you all were preparing to share out the robes, Tissa the louse was very much
          in agony and was running about to and fro in the folds of the robes. If you had taken the robes at that time
          Tissa the louse would have felt very bitter against you and he would have to go to niraya. But now, Tissa has
          been reborn in the Tusita deva world, and that is why I have allowed you to take the robes. Indeed, bhikkhus,
          attachment is very dangerous; as rust corrodes iron from which it is formed, so also, attachment destroys one
          and sends one to niraya. A bhikkhu should not indulge too much in the use of the four requisites or be very
          much attached to them."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 334: In a man who is unmindful craving grows like a creeper. He runs from birth to birth,
          like a monkey seeking fruits in the forest.
          Verse 335: In this world, sorrow grows in one who is overwhelmed by this vile craving that clings to the
          senses, just as well-watered birana grass grows luxuriantly.
          Verse 336: In this world, sorrow falls away from one who overcomes this vile craving that is difficult to get
          rid of, just as water drops fall away from a lotus leaf.
          Verse 337: Therefore, I will deliver this worthy discourse to all of you who have assembled here. Dig up the
          root of craving just as one who wishes to have the fragrant root digs up the birana grass. Do not let Mara
          destroy you again and again, as the flood destroys the reed.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 338: Just as a tree with roots undamaged and firm grows again even though cut down, so
          also, if latent craving is not rooted out, this dukkha (of birth, ageing and death) arises again and again.
          Verse 339: That man of wrong views, in whom the thirty-six streams (of craving) that flow towards pleasurable
          objects are strong, is carried away by his many thoughts connected with passion.
          Verse 340: The stream of craving flows towards all sense objects; the creeper of craving arises (at the six
          sense-doors) and fixes itself (on the six sense objects). Seeing that creeper of craving growing, cut off its
          roots with Magga Insight.
          Verse 341: In beings, there flows happiness that is smeared with craving; those beings attached to pleasure
          and seeking pleasure are, indeed, subject to birth and ageing.
          Verse 342: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare; held fast by fetters and
          bonds they undergo dukkha (round of rebirths) again and again, for a long time.
          Verse 343: People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare. Therefore, One who wishes to
          free himself from craving should eradicate craving.</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 367: He who does not take the mind-and-body aggregate (nama-rupa) as "I and mine", and who
          does not grieve over the dissolution (of mind and body) is, indeed, called a bhikkhu.</li>
        <li>The Story of a Brahmin: When he told the Buddha about this, the Buddha replied to him, "O brahmin! I do not
          call him a brahmana just because he is born of brahmin parents. I call him a brahmana only if he is free from
          moral defilements and cut off all clinging to existence."</li>
        <li>Dhammapada Verse 404: Him I call a brahmana, who associates not with the householder or with the homeless
          one, or with both, who is free from sensual desire and has few wants.</li>
        <li>The Story of Thera Jatila: Some time afterwards, the bhikkhus asked Jatila whether he was still attached to
          his mound of gold and his sons, and he answered that he had no more attachment to them. The bhikkhus then said
          to the Buddha that Jatila was falsely claiming to have attained arahatship. To them the Buddha said,
          "Bhikkhus! Jatila has got rid of craving and pride; he has indeed attained arahatship."</li>

          Quran 2-96: You will surely find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than polytheists. Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But even if they were to live that long, it would not save them from the punishment. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do. 
        </li>
        <li>Quran 2-170: When it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed, "they reply, "No! We only follow what we found our forefathers practicing." Would they still do so, even if their forefathers had absolutely no understanding or guidance?</li>
        <li>Quran 2-211: Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. And whoever trades Allah’s favour—after receiving it—˹for disbelief˺ should know that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.</li>
        <li>Quran 2-232: When you have divorced women and they have reached the end of their waiting period, do not prevent them from re-marrying their ex-husbands if they come to an honourable agreement. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. This is purer and more dignifying for you. Allah knows and you do not know. </li>
        <li>Quran 2-235: There is no blame on you for subtly showing interest in ˹divorced or widowed˺ women1 or for hiding ˹the intention˺ in your hearts. Allah knows that you are considering them ˹for marriage˺. But do not make a secret commitment with them—you can only show interest in them appropriately. Do not commit to the bond of marriage until the waiting period expires. Know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. </li>
        <li>Quran 3-176: ˹O Prophet!˺ Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—surely they will not harm Allah in the least. It is Allah’s Will to disallow them a share in the Hereafter, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-19: O believers! It is not permissible for you to inherit women against their will1 or mistreat them to make them return some of the dowry ˹as a ransom for divorce˺—unless they are found guilty of adultery.2 Treat them fairly. If you happen to dislike them, you may hate something which Allah turns into a great blessing. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-115: And whoever defies the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them and follows a path other than that of the believers, We will let them pursue what they have chosen, then burn them in Hell—what an evil end! </li>
        <li>Quran 5-26: Allah replied, “Then this land is forbidden to them for forty years, during which they will wander through the land. So do not grieve for the rebellious people.” </li>
        <li>Quran 5-41: O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter. </li>
        <li>Quran 7-93: He turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to disbelieve?” </li>
        <li>Quran 9-93: Blame is only on those who seek exemption from you although they have the means. They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and Allah has sealed their hearts so they do not realize ˹the consequences˺. </li>
        <li>Quran 11-37: And build the Ark under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes and directions, and do not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they will surely be drowned.” </li>
        <li>Quran 11-87: They asked ˹sarcastically˺, “O Shu’aib! Does your prayer command you that we should abandon what our forefathers worshipped or give up managing our wealth as we please? Indeed, you are such a tolerant, sensible man!” </li>
        <li>Quran 11-91: They threatened, “O Shu’aib! We do not comprehend much of what you say, and surely we see you powerless among us. Were it not for your clan, we would have certainly stoned you, for you are nothing to us.” </li>
        <li>Quran 12-32: She said, “This is the one for whose love you criticized me! I did try to seduce him but he ˹firmly˺ refused. And if he does not do what I order him to, he will certainly be imprisoned and ˹fully˺ disgraced.”1  
        <li>Quran 15-3: ˹So˺ let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by ˹false˺ hope, for they will soon know. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-57: And they attribute ˹angels as˺ daughters to Allah—glory be to Him!—the opposite of what they desire for themselves. </li>
        <li>Quran 16-82: But if they turn away, then your duty ˹O Prophet˺ is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly. </li>
        <li>Quran 18-45:  And give them a parable of this worldly life. ˹It is˺ like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky. Then they ˹soon˺ turn into chaff scattered by the wind. And Allah is fully capable of ˹doing˺ all things. </li>
        <li>Quran 19-98: ˹Imagine˺ how many peoples We have destroyed before them! Do you ˹still˺ see any of them, or ˹even˺ hear from them the slightest sound? </li>

        <li>Dhammapada Verse 274: This is the only Path, and there is none other for the purity of vision. Follow this
          Path; it will bewilder Mara.</li>
        <li>The Story of Mara: To him the Buddha replied, "O wicked Mara! Your teaching and my teaching are quite
          different. You and I cannot have any discussion. This is my teaching".</li>
        <li>The Story of Mara: On one occasion, Mara came to the Buddha disguised as a man and asked him, "Venerable
          Sir, You often say the word 'param'. What is the meaning of that word?" The Buddha, knowing that it was Mara
          who was asking that question, chided him, "O wicked Mara! The words 'param' and 'aparam' have nothing to do
          with you. 'Param' which means 'the other shore' can be reached only by the arahats who are free from moral
          defilements."</li>

        <li>Quran 2 - 168, 169: O humanity! Eat from what is lawful and good on the earth and do not follow Satan's footsteps. He is truly your sworn enemy. He only incites you to commit evil and indecency, and to claim against Allah what you do not know</li>
        <li>Quran 2-268: The Devil threatens you with ˹the prospect of˺ poverty and bids you to the shameful deed ˹of stinginess˺, while Allah promises you forgiveness and ˹great˺ bounties from Him. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing. </li>
        <li>Quran 4-120: Satan only makes them ˹false˺ promises and deludes them with ˹empty˺ hopes. Truly Satan promises them nothing but delusion. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-90: O believers! Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for decisions1 are all evil of Satan’s handiwork. So shun them so you may be successful. </li>
        <li>Quran 5-91: Satan’s plan is to stir up hostility and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah and praying. Will you not then abstain? </li>
        <li>Quran 6-112: And so We have made for every prophet enemies—devilish humans and jinn—whispering to one another with elegant words of deception. Had it been your Lord’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their deceit, </li>
        <li>Quran 7-200, 201: If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing. Indeed, when Satan whispers to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, they remember ˹their Lord˺ then they start to see ˹things˺ clearly. </li>
        <li>Quran 8-49: And ˹remember˺ when Satan made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, and said, “No one can overcome you today. I am surely by your side.” But when the two forces faced off, he cowered and said, “I have absolutely nothing to do with you. I certainly see what you do not see. I truly fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment.” 
        <li>Quran 12-42: Then he said to the one he knew would survive, “Mention me in the presence of your master.1” But Satan made him forget to mention Joseph to his master, so he remained in prison for several years. </li>
        <li>Quran 14-22: And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise. I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce your previous association of me with Allah ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.” </li>
        <li>Quran 17-64: And incite whoever you can of them with your voice, mobilize against them all your cavalry and infantry, manipulate them in their wealth and children, and make them promises.” But Satan promises them nothing but delusion. </li>
        <li>Quran 18-50: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,1 who was one of the jinn, but he rebelled against the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants as patrons instead of Me, although they are your enemy? What an evil alternative for the wrongdoers ˹to choose˺! </li>
        <li>Quran 18-63: He replied, “Do you remember when we rested by the rock? ˹That is when˺ I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.”1</li>
        <li>Quran 19-44, 45: O  dear father! Do not worship Satan. Surely Satan is ever rebellious against the Most Compassionate. O  dear father! I truly fear that you will be touched by a torment from the Most Compassionate, and become Satan’s companion ˹in Hell˺.” </li>
        <li>Quran 20-116: And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs,1 who refused ˹arrogantly˺. </li>
