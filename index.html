      <p>Let us examine this quote:</p>
      "When the mother is perfect then the child is perfect."</p>
      <p>Or another one:</p>
      <p>"When the teacher is perfect then the student will be perfect."</p>
      <p>
      This idea is not new or unheard of. Reasonably a teacher is someone who arranges a student to become a master.
      And by knowing the soul nature of his student, a bona fide spiritual master understands his disciple, works with his inner nature 
      and evolves him into a master.   
    </p>
    <p>You might be wondering, "student and master, how devotional uncertain and scary!"
      Indeed these concepts are life serious. Yet the main idea that we are trying to get at is not 
      to urge you to find a spiritual master; but for you to recognize the principle of preparation. 
      To also recognize the importance of the work inbetween the objective and the project outcome. It is
      highly important to figure things out properly and correctly in order to find the better outcome of reality.
    </p>

      In the Christian bible, there was a young man named Joseph. Joseph was
      summoned by Pharoah to interpret a dream. This dream contained 7 healthy
      and 7 unhealthy cows. Joseph was able to interpret that the 7 healthy
      cows foretold 7 years of agricultural abundance - likewise the other 7
      unhealthy cows symbolized famine in the land. Having common sense and
      reason Joseph warned Pharoah that the easy 7 years of blessings should
      be used to accomadate for the difficult 7 years of upcoming hardship.
      This made total sense to Pharoah and Pharoah was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, it's important for us today to have the right mindset. When we
      have a firm understanding of life we are able to understand and make use
      of the world.
