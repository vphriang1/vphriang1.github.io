            Fine words and an insinuating apperance are seldom associated with true virtue (C.A. verse 6)
          </li>
          <li>
            He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his
            dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his
            speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified: such a person may be said
            indeed to love to learn (C.A. verse 22) </li>
          <li>
            Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, "He acts before he speaks, and
            afterwards speaks according to his actions" (C.A. verse 50)</li>
          <li>The studnet of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery?
            But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of
            drinking. In his contention, he is still the CHun-tsze (C.A. verse 74)</li>
          <li>It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man is selected a residence
            do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise? (C.A. verse 102)</li>
          <li>Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a
            condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue (C.A. verse 103)</li>
          <li>It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others (C.A. verse 104)</li>
          <li>If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness (C.A. verse 105)</li>
          <li>If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name? (C.A. verse 107)</li>
          <li>The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of
            haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it (C.A. verse 108)</li>
          <li>I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue,
            would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that
            he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person (C.A. verse 109)</li>

          <li>To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity;
            economy in expenditure, and love for men and the employment of the people at the proper seasons. (C.A. verse
            8)</li>
          <li>Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set
            aside the upright, then the people will not submit (C.A. verse 57)</li>
          <li>I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without
            the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?
            (C.A. verse 61)</li>
          <li>Tsze-hsia asked, saying, "What is the meaning of the passage-"The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The
            well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?"<br>The Master said, "The
            buisiness of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground." (C.A. verse 75-76)</li>
          <li>A prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their

            of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything."

            eagerly seek to be virtous (C.A. verse 58)</li>
          <li>If a man be wihout the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man
            be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music? (C.A. verse 68)</li>

          <li>The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known.
            The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known.

            have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions
            for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument (C.A. verse 56)</li>
