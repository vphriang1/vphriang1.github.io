Prophet - a seer and a teacher, that lead people to a higher plane of life...

Good health practices -
<p>Try to wake up before 6 a.m. fully rested.</p>
    <p>Drink water after you wake up as opposed to juice, coffee etc.</p>
    <p>Proper washing -- Turn the water warm. Brush your hair before getting it wet. Shampoo all of your hair
      and massage your scalp. Use a cleaning agent like bar soap to clean your body. (make sure anything rubbed against
      your skin before or after applying your soap does not smell bad.)
      Wash your face at the sink with warm water to open your facial pores and then rinse your face with cold water to
      close your facial pores.
      Scrub your bodies at least once or twice a week. Rince your hair with cold water. Apply lotion on your skin
      immediately right after washing.
    </p>
    <p>Brush your teeth for 2 minutes every morning. If your breakfast had acidic foods, brush before you eat. Then
      rinse your mouth after you eat breakfast. Brush your teeth at least 2 times a day.
      After you eat, don't brush your teeth too soon. Let the food acids wear off instead of brushing your teeth with
      the food acids.
      Brush in a circular motion. Don't brush your tooth too hard. Try to brush as if you are massaging your whole
      tooth. Brush smarter not better. Try to get all the hiding bacteria and brush even into the gumline.
      Don't forget to brush your gums alongside your gums. Use an effective tooth brush. Don't defeat the purpose..
    </p>
    <p>Allow yourself proper time to prepare yourself for the whole day without rush.</p>
    <p>Appropriate breakfast foods:</p>
    <p>It is recommended to change used clothes for clean clothes everyday.</p>

    <h2>Our philosophical values</h2>

    <p>This section gives people universal principles to clear dogma and expand people's philosophical comprehension.

    <h2>Problem solving</h2>

    <p>Let us examine this quote:</p>
    <p>"When the mother is perfect then the child is perfect."</p>
    <p>Or another one:</p>
    <p>"When the teacher is perfect then the student will be perfect."</p>
    <p>
      Such a statment may raise lots of questions. It may also raise lots of doubts. But sometimes we must understand
      that not everything is meant literally.
      Some things are said in order to suggest a principle which lies beneath the surface.</p>
    <p> A leader helps his follower become like his or her self.
      And when coupling with the idea of "perfection", it means helping the follower know enough to become who their
      leader is.</p>
    <p>Likewise life is like a maze. He must navigate through the right portals to reach the end.
      And to achieve true success he must have the sufficient qualities within himself in order to acquire what he wants
      to become.</p>
    <p>He must be complete piece by piece. He must be precise step by step. Only those who know can lead the way. Only
      perfect conditions can create perfect outcomes.

    </p>
    <p>Let us look at an example.</p>
    <p>
      There was a young man named Joseph. Joseph was
      summoned by Pharoah to interpret a dream. This dream contained 7 healthy
      and 7 unhealthy cows. Joseph was able to interpret that the 7 healthy
      cows foretold 7 years of agricultural abundance - likewise the other 7
      unhealthy cows symbolized famine in the land. Having common sense and
      reason Joseph warned Pharoah that the easy 7 years of blessings should
      be used to accomadate for the difficult 7 years of coming hardship.
      This made total sense to Pharoah and Pharoah was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, Joseph in this story had the right tools of the mind. He changed the outcome from failure to success.</p>
    <p> Regardless of whether
      we look at the world spiritually or not, Joseph had answers that worked. Say if Pharoah lied about a dream or say
      if Joseph lied about being a dream interpreter, Joseph's
      response to Pharoah was valuable on it's own. </p>
    <p>Step by step, question by question, and principle by principle, Joseph closed all of the doubts and filled in the
      blanks.
